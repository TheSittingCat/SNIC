5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the plates, obj5 is a dirty plate, obj1 is decorative, and obj7 is clean. Since the task is cleaning and the plate requested is likely the dirty one to be cleaned, the best match is obj5, the dirty plate."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Taylor is next to the objects and presumably using or holding some, and Jordan is asking for the cup, the best choice is the clean cup (object 4) because the dirty cups (objects 1, 6) are dirty and should be cleaned but may not be the ones Taylor can hand over immediately. The decorative cup (object 8) should not be used (Norm 4). The clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over in this context."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the fork, it implies the fork should be clean and ready for use or cleaning. Among the forks, obj1 is dirty, and obj6 is clean. It is more appropriate to hand the clean fork (obj6) rather than the dirty one, as handing a dirty fork would not be useful in a cleaning context. Therefore, the target object is obj6, the clean fork."
1,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or old, and Skyler is next to multiple mugs (clean, dirty, old), the best choice is the clean mug (obj1) because it is the most straightforward and safe option to hand over. The dirty and old mugs are less likely to be handed over for cleaning or use, and the clean mug is the most appropriate object to serve or handle in this context."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: object 4 (clean cup) and object 6 (dirty cup). Since Jordan is cleaning, they would want the dirty cup to clean it. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that Taylor is using the dirty cup. Therefore, the correct cup to hand over is the dirty cup, object 6."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: one decorative (obj1) and one dirty (obj4), and one clean fork (obj5). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative is irrelevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. The dirty fork (obj4) is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the fork referred to is the dirty fork, obj4."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 2 (clean fork) and object 4 (dirty fork). Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork to hand over is the dirty fork (object 4). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the correct object is the dirty fork, object 4."
7,"Cameron is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but also prioritize hazards. However, the request is to hand a plate, not to clean it directly. The clean plate (object 7) is the most likely candidate to be handed because it is clean and usable, whereas the dirty plate (object 6) is not suitable to be handed for use. The decorative plate (object 5) is excluded because it is decorative and not for serving or cleaning. Therefore, the clean plate (object 7) is the appropriate object to hand over."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: obj1 (dirty spoon) and obj3 (clean spoon), and obj6 (decorative spoon). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no indication that Taylor is using any spoon. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty spoon (obj1) to clean."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: one decorative (obj1) and one dirty (obj5). Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Therefore, the dirty mug (obj5) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 3 (dirty fork) and object 4 (clean fork). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant fork is the dirty one (object 3). Therefore, the target object is the dirty fork, object 3."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 3 (dirty spoon) and object 5 (clean spoon). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (object 3) is the relevant one to be handed over for cleaning. Therefore, the correct object is 3."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 3 (dirty plate) and object 6 (clean plate). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (object 3) is the relevant object. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 3) is the correct choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are three forks: obj1 (clean fork), obj2 (dirty fork), and obj6 (old fork). The old fork is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is ambiguous. The dirty fork (obj2) is the best candidate to be cleaned. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is being used. Therefore, the dirty fork (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Riley is next to multiple cups: a clean cup (obj1), a dirty cup (obj2), an old cup (obj5), and a decorative cup (obj8). Since Morgan is cleaning, the most relevant cup to hand over would be the clean cup (obj1) because it is not dirty and not decorative, and it is a straightforward choice for handing over without conflict. The dirty cup (obj2) should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over, and the decorative cup (obj8) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The old cup (obj5) is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the clean cup (obj1) is the best choice for ""the cup"" Morgan refers to."
6,"Cameron is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. The dirty mug (object 4) is dirty but might be considered for cleaning, however, the clean mug (object 6) is the best candidate to hand over because it is clean and a mug, matching the referring expression ""the mug."" The decorative mug (object 1) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a mug, the clean mug is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is not dirty or decorative and fits the request."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but here the request is simply to hand a plate, not necessarily to clean it. Among the plates, object 2 is dirty, and object 5 is clean. Since the request is to hand ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and given that handing a clean plate is more appropriate for serving or general use, the clean plate (object 5) is the best choice. Also, Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but here the task is handing, not cleaning. Therefore, object 5 is the correct referent."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" There are two plates: object 3 (clean plate) and object 4 (dirty plate). Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and requests the plate, it is most logical that they want the clean plate (object 3) to use or serve, rather than the dirty plate (object 4) which is to be cleaned. Therefore, the clean plate (object 3) is the correct referent."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but here Morgan is asking for a plate to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning it immediately. The plate requested should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3) and not decorative (Norm 4). Among the plates, obj4 is dirty, obj2 is decorative, and obj7 is clean. Therefore, the clean plate (obj7) is the appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Taylor is next to the objects, so likely the object to be handed is clean and ready to be used or cleaned. The dirty plate (obj1) is dirty but might be the one to clean, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand ""the plate,"" it is more logical to hand the clean plate (obj2) for use or further cleaning. The decorative plate (obj4) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 2 (dirty bowl) and object 4 (clean bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty bowl (object 2) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. However, since Alex is asking for a spoon, it implies they want a clean spoon to use or handle. The clean spoon (object 2) is appropriate because it is clean and not dirty or hazardous. The dirty spoon (object 3) should be cleaned but is not the best choice to hand over. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 2) is the correct object to hand."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Riley is next to several mugs: a decorative mug (obj3), a dirty mug (obj4), and a clean mug (obj6). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty mugs (obj2 and obj4) are dirty, but the dirty cup (obj2) is not a mug, and the dirty mug (obj4) is dirty but might be the one to clean. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the mug, it is more likely they want the clean mug (obj6) to use or handle, as the dirty mugs should be cleaned by Morgan, not handed over. Therefore, the clean mug (obj6) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). There are two bowls: object 2 (clean bowl) and object 6 (dirty bowl). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty bowl (object 6) would be the priority to clean. However, handing over a clean bowl (object 2) is more likely because the dirty bowl might be intended for cleaning by Cameron themselves, and the clean bowl is safe to handle and use. The decorative bowl (object 7) should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4). Therefore, the best choice is object 2, the clean bowl."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Among the spoons, object 3 is clean, object 4 is dirty, and object 6 is decorative. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so decorative items are less relevant. Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want the dirty spoon to clean it (object 4). However, the request is to ""hand them the spoon,"" which implies the spoon to be used or handled now. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items apply to serving and cooking, not cleaning. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, so the dirty spoon (object 4) is the best choice. But since the request is to hand ""the spoon"" and the clean spoon (object 3) is available, and the dirty spoon is dirty and might be avoided for handing, the best fit is the dirty spoon (object 4) because Casey is cleaning and would want the dirty spoon to clean it. Therefore, the target object is 4."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are decorative or clean. Among the forks, obj5 is clean, obj6 is old (not specified as dirty), and obj7 is dirty. Since the task is cleaning and the fork requested is likely the one that needs cleaning, the dirty fork (obj7) is the appropriate choice."
3,"Jordan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not use items that are decorative or currently being used by someone. Taylor is next to both a dirty plate (obj1) and a clean plate (obj3). Since Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" and the clean plate is more likely to be the one to be handed over (as the dirty plate should be cleaned by Jordan themselves), the clean plate (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Jordan directly, and the decorative plate should not be used. Therefore, the clean plate (obj3) is the best choice."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 4 (clean spoon) and object 7 (dirty spoon). Norm 2 prioritizes dirty items for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is being used. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 7) is the appropriate choice."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to the objects and presumably not using any spoon, the choice should be a spoon that is clean or dirty. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is indicated here. The dirty spoon (obj7) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the spoon, it is more likely they want a clean spoon to use or handle. The old spoon (obj2) is old but not necessarily dirty. The clean spoon (obj1) is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and a spoon, matching the referring expression ""the spoon."" Therefore, obj1 is the target object."
4,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards. However, Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a mug, implying the mug should be clean and ready for use or handling. Among the mugs, obj4 is a clean mug, obj6 is decorative (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving or cleaning), and obj7 is dirty. Since Morgan is cleaning and asking for ""the mug,"" the best choice is the clean mug (obj4) to avoid handling dirty or decorative items unnecessarily. Therefore, the target object is obj4."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for the cup, the best choice is the clean cup (object 5) because the dirty cups (objects 1 and 3) are dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is simply to hand ""the cup,"" which typically refers to a clean, usable cup. The decorative cup (object 4) is not appropriate for cleaning or serving. Therefore, object 5 is the most suitable cup to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Charlie is next to the cups, and Cameron is cleaning, the best choice is the clean cup (obj2) because the dirty cups (obj3 and obj5) are either dirty or old, but the clean cup is the one that can be handed over without conflict. The request is simply to hand the cup, not necessarily to clean it, so the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 2 (dirty bowl) and object 4 (clean bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty bowl (object 2) is the relevant object to be handed for cleaning. The clean bowl (object 4) is not the target because it does not need cleaning."
4,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. There are two plates: obj2 (clean plate) and obj4 (dirty plate). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (obj4) is the relevant object to be handed. The decorative plate (obj6) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty plate (obj4) is the correct choice."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: obj1 (old fork) and obj4 (dirty fork). The old fork is not specified as dirty, but obj4 is explicitly dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork (obj4) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: object 3 is decorative and object 6 is dirty.

6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 3 (dirty bowl) and object 6 (clean bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Casey is asking to hand over a bowl, not specifically to clean it. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but that does not apply here. Since the request is to hand over the bowl, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean bowl (object 6) rather than the dirty one (object 3), as handing a clean bowl is more useful and aligns with the general purpose of the task. Therefore, object 6 is the correct choice."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Alex is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or old, the most reasonable choice is the clean cup (object 3) because it is the only clean cup available. The dirty cup (object 5) and old cup (object 7) are dirty or old, and the clean cup is the only clean cup that fits the referring expression ""the cup."" Therefore, the clean cup (object 3) is the target object."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the cups, object 3 is a dirty cup, object 1 is decorative, and object 7 is clean. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the cup,"" the most relevant cup to clean is the dirty cup (object 3). The decorative cup (object 1) should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean cup (object 7) does not need cleaning. Therefore, the best choice is object 3, the dirty cup."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that any fork is hazardous or currently in use. The dirty forks are obj2 (old fork), obj6 (dirty fork), and obj5 is decorative (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here it's cleaning). Since the request is to hand ""the fork,"" the most straightforward interpretation is the clean fork (obj7), as it is the one that can be handed without conflict or hazard. The dirty forks are likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but handing the clean fork is more practical for the cleaning task. Therefore, the clean fork (obj7) is the best choice."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Morgan is asking for a bowl to be handed, not necessarily to be cleaned immediately. Norm 1 and Norm 3 indicate that for serving or cooking tasks, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want a clean bowl to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The dirty bowl (obj4) and old bowl (obj3) are less likely to be handed as they are dirty or old, and the decorative bowl (obj6) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean bowl (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 5). Among the cups, obj2 is a dirty cup, which fits the cleaning task and the referring expression ""the cup."" The dirty mug (obj1) is not a cup, and the clean cup (obj3), old cup (obj4), and decorative cup (obj6) do not fit the priority of cleaning dirty items. Therefore, the correct object is obj2."

The dirty spoons (objects 4 and 3) are dirty, but object 3 is old and object 4 is dirty. However, the request is to hand ""the spoon,"" which typically implies a clean or usable spoon rather than a dirty or old one. The decorative spoon (6) is excluded by Norm 4. The clean spoon (7) is the best candidate to hand over because it is a spoon and clean, making it suitable for use or cleaning tasks without violating norms about handling dirty or decorative items. Therefore, object 7 is the target."

The decorative fork (obj4) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork (obj5) is the appropriate object to hand."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 1 (dirty spoon) and object 2 (clean spoon). Norm 5 states that in cleaning, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either spoon is in use. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is a cleaning task, so object 7 (decorative spoon) is excluded. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty spoon (object 1) to clean."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Morgan is asking for a fork to be handed, it implies the fork is to be used, not cleaned. Therefore, the fork to be handed should be clean (Norm 3). The clean fork is object 7, while the dirty fork is object 3. The decorative fork (object 2) is not appropriate for use (Norm 4). Hence, the correct fork to hand over is the clean fork, object 7."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" There are two spoons: object 5 (clean spoon) and object 6 (dirty spoon). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, Morgan would want the dirty spoon (object 6) to clean it. Hence, the correct object is 6."
3,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 3 (dirty spoon) and object 4 (clean spoon). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (object 3) is the relevant one to be handed for cleaning."
4,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs, obj4 is a dirty mug, obj1 is clean, and obj5 is old but not specified as dirty. Since Morgan is cleaning, the request for ""the mug"" likely refers to the dirty mug that needs cleaning, which is obj4."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: object 2 (clean cup) and object 5 (dirty cup). Since the task is cleaning, the relevant cup is the dirty one (object 5). Therefore, the correct object is the dirty cup, object 5."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: one clean (obj1) and one dirty (obj5). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty mug (obj5) is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. The decorative mug (obj6) is not appropriate as it is decorative, and Norm 4 applies to serving tasks, not cleaning. Therefore, the dirty mug (obj5) is the correct choice."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is asking for a plate, it implies they want a clean plate to use or handle, not a dirty one. The dirty plate (obj5) is dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is specifically for ""the plate,"" which typically refers to a clean plate in this context. Therefore, the clean plate (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty cups (obj2 is old cup but not specified as dirty, obj3 is dirty cup). However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Bailey is next to the objects and Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the cup, it implies the cup should be clean and ready to use or handle. Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here because the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. The clean cup (obj6) is the best candidate to hand over because it is clean and a cup, matching the referring expression ""the cup."" The dirty cups are likely to be cleaned by Alex, but the request is to hand over a cup, which would be the clean one. Therefore, obj6 is the target object."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: an old bowl (obj2), a clean bowl (obj6), and a dirty bowl (obj7). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards. Since no hazards or usage are indicated, the best choice is the dirty bowl (obj7). But since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl to be used or cleaned. The clean bowl (obj6) is more likely to be handed over for use or cleaning preparation, while the dirty bowl (obj7) is to be cleaned but not necessarily handed over. The old bowl (obj2) is less specific and might be less relevant. Given the request ""the bowl"" without further specification, the clean bowl (obj6) is the most reasonable choice to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and the referring expression is ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, there is a clean bowl (object 5) and a dirty bowl (object 6). Since the dirty bowl fits the cleaning task better, and it is not decorative or clean, the dirty bowl (object 6) is the appropriate choice."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is simply to hand the mug, not necessarily to clean it, and there are two mugs (one dirty and one clean), the clean mug (object 4) is the appropriate one to hand over because it is ready for use and not dirty. The dirty mug (object 3) should be cleaned by Casey, but handing the clean mug is more suitable here."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 2 (clean fork) and object 3 (dirty fork). Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork is the dirty one (object 3). Therefore, Bailey should hand Alex the dirty fork."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the bowl"" and there are two bowls (one dirty and one clean), the clean bowl (obj4) is more likely the one to be handed for cleaning or use. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but since Taylor is next to the objects and Jordan is cleaning, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Jordan directly, but the request to ""hand me the bowl"" implies the clean bowl is the one to be handed."
8,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons present, obj8 is a dirty spoon, which fits the cleaning task.

2,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present (objects 2, 3, and 7), object 2 is a dirty cup, object 3 is a clean cup, and object 7 is an old cup (not specified as dirty). Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the cup,"" the most relevant cup to hand over is the dirty cup (object 2) to be cleaned. This aligns with the norm to clean dirty items during cleaning tasks."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons, obj4 is clean, obj5 is decorative, and obj7 is dirty. Since obj7 is a dirty spoon, it fits the cleaning task requirement. The decorative spoon (obj5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the correct object is obj7, the dirty spoon."
1,"The referring expression is ""the mug."" There are two mugs: object 1 (clean mug) and object 4 (dirty mug).

Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but Taylor is next to both mugs. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Jordan is cleaning and wants the mug, it is most logical to hand the clean mug (obj1) to avoid handling dirty items unnecessarily and to maintain hygiene. Therefore, the clean mug (obj1) is the appropriate choice."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

7,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the cup is a hazard or currently in use. Among the cups, obj5 is dirty, obj3 is old, obj4 is measuring, and obj7 is clean. Since Jordan is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or old, and given that obj5 and obj6 are dirty but obj6 is a bowl, the best fit is the clean cup (obj7) because it is the only clean cup and likely the one to be handed for cleaning or use. However, since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the cup,"" the most logical choice is the clean cup (obj7) to be handed over, possibly for cleaning or use.

2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the bowls, obj2 is dirty, obj1 is clean, and obj3 is old. The dirty bowl (obj2) is the most relevant for cleaning.

Therefore, the clean cup (obj1) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for ""the mug,"" the best choice is the dirty mug (object 2). However, the dirty mug is object 2, but the instruction is to hand ""the mug,"" and the clean mug (object 6) is also a mug. Since the task is cleaning, Alex would want the dirty mug to clean it. Therefore, the target object should be object 2 (dirty mug).

Correction: The initial choice was object 6, but the dirty mug is object 2, which aligns with the cleaning task. So the correct target is object 2."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for a bowl, the best choice is a clean bowl (obj6) because the dirty bowl (obj1) might be prioritized for cleaning but is not specified as being used or hazardous. The decorative bowl (obj3) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean bowl (obj6) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Since the task is cleaning, the priority is to clean dirty items (obj5). However, the request is to ""hand them the fork,"" which implies the fork to be used or handled should be clean (Norm 1 and 3). The decorative fork (obj7) should not be used (Norm 4). The old fork (obj4) is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is ambiguous. The best choice is the clean fork (obj3) because it is the appropriate fork to hand over during cleaning, avoiding decorative or dirty items."

According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. However, since Jordan is asking for the spoon, it implies the spoon is needed for cleaning or handling. Among the spoons, obj3 is clean, obj4 is decorative, and obj5 is dirty. Norm 4 states not to use decorative items in serving, and by extension, decorative items are not typically used in cleaning tasks. The clean spoon (obj3) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and usable, while the dirty spoon (obj5) should be cleaned, not handed over. Therefore, the clean spoon (obj3) is the correct choice."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a mug, it is most logical to hand over a clean mug (object 4) rather than a dirty or old mug, as the clean mug is ready to be used or handled without conflict. The dirty mugs (objects 5 and 6) are likely to be cleaned by Casey, but handing over a clean mug fits the request best."
5,"Morgan is cleaning in the banquet hall and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates, there is a dirty plate (obj5), a dirty spoon (obj2), a decorative plate (obj4), and a clean plate (obj7). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty plate to clean it. The decorative plate should not be used in a serving task (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean plate is not dirty, so it is less likely to be the target. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj5) is the most appropriate object to be referred to as ""the plate"" in this cleaning context."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" There are two cups: object 2 (clean cup) and object 6 (dirty cup). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either cup is being used. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty cup (object 6) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" There are two mugs: one clean (obj3) and one dirty (obj4). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either mug is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned related to mugs. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for ""the mug,"" it is most logical that Alex wants the clean mug (obj3) to use or serve, as the dirty mug (obj4) would be the one to clean, not to hand over. Therefore, the referred mug is the clean mug (obj3)."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks, obj1 is dirty, obj2 is clean, obj6 is old, and obj8 is decorative. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork, obj1."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Taylor is next to multiple mugs: a dirty mug (obj3), a clean mug (obj6), and a decorative mug (obj7). The dirty mug is likely to be the one needing cleaning, but since Taylor is next to the mugs and Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them a mug, it is more reasonable that Jordan wants the clean mug (obj6) to use or serve with, as the dirty mug is not appropriate to hand over in a cleaning context. The decorative mug (obj7) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug (obj6) is the best choice to hand over."
4,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, it implies the fork is not currently being used by Morgan. There are two forks: obj2 (dirty fork) and obj4 (clean fork). Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want the dirty fork (obj2) to clean it. However, Riley is next to the objects, and the request is to hand the fork, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean fork (obj4) because it is more likely to be handed over for use or inspection, and the dirty fork might be avoided due to dirtiness and potential contamination. Therefore, the target object is obj4, the clean fork."
5,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are clean unless necessary. However, since Morgan is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Riley is next to both a dirty plate (obj1) and a clean plate (obj5), the most reasonable interpretation is that Morgan wants the clean plate (obj5) to use or handle it properly during cleaning or serving preparation. The dirty plate (obj1) is likely to be cleaned but not handed as ""the plate"" in this context. Therefore, the clean plate (obj5) is the target object."
7,"Jordan is cleaning in the garden and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items if needed, but more importantly, Norm 2 and Norm 5 say to clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Jordan is cleaning and asking for a mug, it is most logical that they want the clean mug (object 7) rather than the dirty mugs (object 5) or the decorative mug (object 3). The clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over for use or cleaning purposes."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is cleaning and wants the spoon, the best choice is the clean spoon (object 2) because Norm 1 and 3 about using clean items apply to serving and cooking, not cleaning. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but handing over a clean spoon is more appropriate for cleaning tasks to avoid contamination or spreading dirt. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 2) is the correct choice."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Charlie is next to the objects and presumably not using the clean plate, and the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Cameron, the clean plate is the one to be handed to Cameron for use or cleaning. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Cameron, but since the request is to hand ""the plate,"" the clean plate is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is clean and ready for use or further action."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs, obj1 is a dirty mug, obj4 is a clean mug, and obj7 is a decorative mug. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty mug (obj1) to clean. Hence, the target object is 1."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: obj1 (clean bowl) and obj5 (dirty bowl). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty bowl (obj5) is the relevant object to be cleaned and thus the one Jordan is referring to. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is being used. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj5) is the correct choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 5). Among the forks, obj2 is a dirty fork, obj5 is a decorative fork, and obj6 is a clean fork. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork to hand over is the dirty fork (obj2), as it needs cleaning."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Casey is cleaning and the spoon is dirty, the dirty spoon (object 2) is the appropriate choice. The clean spoon (object 4) is not relevant for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 2) is the correct object to hand over."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork.""

However, since Cameron is asking for the fork, it implies the fork is needed for cleaning or handling. There are two forks: obj1 (dirty fork) and obj5 (clean fork). Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but Norm 5 advises not to touch items in use unless necessary. Since the clean fork (obj5) is not dirty and is more appropriate to handle or use in cleaning, and the dirty fork (obj1) is dirty and likely to be cleaned, the best choice is the clean fork (obj5) to hand over. Also, the dirty fork might be more hazardous or require cleaning, but the request is simply for ""the fork,"" which typically refers to the clean one in this context."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 4 (clean plate) and object 6 (dirty plate). Since the task is cleaning, the relevant plate is the dirty one, object 6. Therefore, the plate Jordan refers to is the dirty plate, object 6."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: obj2 (dirty bowl), obj4 (old bowl), and obj7 (clean bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty bowl (obj2) fits this criterion. The old bowl (obj4) is not specified as dirty, and the clean bowl (obj7) should not be cleaned. Therefore, the most appropriate object to refer to is the dirty bowl, obj2."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using clean items unnecessarily. Among the two bowls present, object 2 is a dirty bowl and object 6 is a clean bowl. Since Morgan is cleaning, it makes sense they want the dirty bowl to clean it. Therefore, the target object is object 2, the dirty bowl."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want to clean a dirty fork. However, the request is to hand ""the fork,"" and the clean fork (obj4) is also present. Since the dirty fork is dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is to hand the fork, the best choice is the clean fork (obj4) because handing a clean fork is more practical and aligns with the norm of not using dirty items for serving or handing.

5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate.

7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but also prioritize hazards. However, handing a plate implies giving a usable, clean plate rather than a dirty or old one.

Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a bowl, it is most logical that they want a clean bowl to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The clean bowl (object 3) fits the request best as it is a bowl and is clean, making it appropriate for handling during cleaning. The dirty bowls (objects 6 and 8) are less likely to be requested to be handed over for cleaning purposes, and the decorative bowl (object 2) should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4).

4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for the bowl, it implies they want to clean or handle it. There are two bowls: object 3 (dirty bowl) and object 4 (clean bowl). Norm 5 suggests not touching items in use, but since Casey is cleaning, they likely want the dirty bowl to clean it. However, the request is simply ""the bowl,"" and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the dirty bowl (object 3). But since the request is to hand ""the bowl"" and Norm 5 says not to touch items in use, and no indication that the dirty bowl is in use, the dirty bowl is the best fit. However, the dirty bowl is object 3, so the target should be 3.

Correction: The initial choice was 4 (clean bowl), but the dirty bowl (3) is the one to clean. So the correct target is 3."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Casey is asking for a fork, it implies the fork is to be used or cleaned. Among the forks present, obj2 is a clean fork, obj6 is an old fork, and obj7 is a dirty fork. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (obj7) would be the priority to clean, but the request is simply ""the fork,"" which typically refers to a clean or usable fork. The old fork (obj6) might be less likely to be used. Therefore, the best choice is obj2, the clean fork, as it is the most straightforward interpretation of ""the fork"" and aligns with the norms for cleaning tasks where clean tools are preferred for use."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a spoon, the best choice is the clean spoon (object 2) because the dirty spoon (object 6) is dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is simply to hand over a spoon, not necessarily to clean it. The decorative spoon (object 1) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon (object 2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."

6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: object 4 (clean mug) and object 6 (dirty mug). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty one, object 6."

Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so decorative bowl is less relevant. The dirty bowl (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning.

5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools are used, but here the task is cleaning, so that does not apply. Norm 2 says in cleaning tasks, you should clean dirty items, but Casey is asking for a spoon to be handed, not necessarily to clean it. Norm 5 says in cleaning tasks, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but that does not apply here. Norm 1 and 4 relate to serving, which is not the current task. Since Casey is cleaning and asks for ""the spoon,"" the most reasonable interpretation is that Casey wants a clean spoon to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The decorative spoon (obj3) is excluded by Norm 4 (serving) and general logic. The dirty spoon (obj6) is dirty and likely to be cleaned, but handing a dirty spoon is less likely. The clean spoon (obj5) is the best candidate to be handed. Therefore, the target object is obj5."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: obj3 (dirty bowl) and obj5 (clean bowl).

3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Taylor is next to the objects. The dirty mugs (obj1) and dirty cup (obj2) are dirty but might be considered for cleaning. The clean mug (obj3) is clean and thus not a priority for cleaning. The decorative mug (obj7) should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but this is a cleaning task. Since Jordan is asking for ""the mug"" and the clean mug (obj3) is the only clean mug, it is likely the one being referred to for handing over, possibly to use or move it. The dirty mugs are less likely because they are dirty and the task is cleaning, but the request is to hand ""the mug,"" which implies a specific, singular mug, likely the clean one. Therefore, obj3 is the best fit."
2,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty mug (object 2) for cleaning."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The clean fork (obj1) is clean and not dirty, so it is less likely to be the target for cleaning. The decorative fork (obj2) is decorative and should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty fork (obj7) is the best candidate. However, the referring expression is ""the fork,"" which is ambiguous. Since the clean fork is more likely to be handed over (clean and ready to use), and the task is cleaning, Alex might want the clean fork to use or to clean. But since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (obj7) is the object to be cleaned and thus the one Alex would want. Therefore, the target object is 7.

Correction: The initial output was 1, but based on the reasoning, the correct target is 7."
7,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, the request is to hand over ""the mug,"" which implies a specific mug that is likely usable or clean rather than dirty or decorative. The dirty mugs (obj3 and obj5) are dirty or old, and obj6 is decorative, which Norm 4 says should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The clean mug (obj7) is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is a mug and clean, making it suitable for use or cleaning without conflict. Therefore, the clean mug (obj7) is the correct choice."

2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The dirty fork (object 2) fits the cleaning task as it is dirty and a fork, while the clean fork (object 5) is not dirty and the decorative fork (object 6) should not be used. Therefore, the dirty fork (object 2) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the cup, it implies the cup is not currently being used by Morgan. Among the cups, obj2 is a dirty cup, obj5 is a decorative cup, and obj7 is a clean cup. Norm 4 says in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items apply to serving and cooking, not cleaning. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want to clean the dirty cup (obj2), but the request is to ""hand me the cup,"" which suggests the cup is clean and ready to be used or handled. Also, the dirty cup is dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is simply to hand the cup, not to clean it. The clean cup (obj7) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and not decorative or dirty. Therefore, the target object is obj7, the clean cup."

1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for a cup, the most logical choice is the clean cup (obj1) because it is ready to be used or handled without conflict. The dirty cup (obj2) is dirty and should be cleaned but might not be the one Cameron is asking for to hand over. The clean cup is the best fit for ""the cup"" in this context."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork.""

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger.

According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not necessarily hand over dirty items unless specified. The decorative spoon (obj1) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The dirty spoon (obj7) is dirty and likely needs cleaning, but handing over a dirty spoon may not be appropriate unless specified. The clean spoon (obj2) is the best candidate to hand over because it is a spoon and clean, making it suitable for use or cleaning without contamination. Therefore, the clean spoon (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a cup, it is likely for use rather than cleaning. Norm 1 and 3 do not apply as this is not a serving or cooking task. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. The decorative cup (obj6) should not be used. The dirty cup (obj5) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Casey is asking for a cup to hand over, the clean cup (obj7) is the appropriate choice to hand over.

Since Skyler is next to the objects and Casey is cleaning, the most appropriate mug to hand over is the clean mug (obj2) because the dirty mug (obj1) is dirty and should be cleaned by Casey, but handing the clean mug is more practical for immediate use or cleaning. The decorative mug (obj7) should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug (obj2) is the best choice to hand over."

The dirty spoon (object 5) is dirty but might be less likely to be handed over if the speaker wants a spoon to use or clean. The decorative spoon (object 6) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, object 2 is the most appropriate spoon to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Alex is cleaning and asks for a mug, the best choice is the clean mug (object 7) because the dirty mugs (object 2) and decorative mug (object 6) are either dirty or decorative, and the clean mug is the appropriate item to hand over for use or cleaning.

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazard is mentioned here. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want the dirty spoon (object 6) to clean it. However, the request is to ""hand me the spoon,"" which usually implies the clean spoon to use or handle. But since the task is cleaning, the focus is on dirty items. Norm 5 says not to touch items in use unless preventing danger, but no such danger is indicated. Therefore, the best fit is object 6, the dirty spoon, as the one to be cleaned. However, since the request is to hand ""the spoon"" and the clean spoon is available, and the dirty spoon is dirty and should be cleaned, the most logical is object 6. But the question is which spoon is being referred to. The clean spoon is object 1, the decorative spoon is object 3 (excluded by Norm 4), and the dirty spoon is object 6. Since Cameron is cleaning, they want the dirty spoon (object 6). Therefore, the target object is 6."

Taylor is next to multiple mugs: a clean mug (obj4), an old mug (obj5), and a dirty mug (obj6). Since Jordan is cleaning and asking for a mug, the most appropriate choice is the clean mug (obj4) because it is likely the one to be used or handled safely without conflict. The dirty mug (obj6) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Taylor is next to the mugs and Jordan is asking for a mug to be handed, the clean mug is the best fit for the request.

2,"Morgan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: obj1 (clean cup) and obj2 (dirty cup). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant cup to hand over is the dirty cup (obj2) to be cleaned. The decorative cup (obj4) is not appropriate as per Norm 4 and is not the one referred to as ""the cup."" Therefore, the target object is obj2, the dirty cup."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: obj2 (clean cup) and obj5 (dirty cup). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty cup (obj5) is the appropriate object to hand over. The decorative cup (obj1) is not suitable as per Norm 4, and the clean cup is not the priority in cleaning. Therefore, the dirty cup (obj5) is the correct choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. There are two spoons: object 2 (clean spoon) and object 6 (dirty spoon). Since Cameron is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon to clean it, but Norm 5 says not to touch something that isn't yours unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards exist. The request is simply to hand ""the spoon,"" and the clean spoon (object 2) is more likely to be handed because it is clean and ready to be used or handled safely. Therefore, the best choice is object 2, the clean spoon."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards. Since Cameron is asking for ""the fork"" and there are two forks: one clean (obj2) and one dirty (obj5). The dirty fork is likely the one to be cleaned, but Cameron is requesting the fork to hand over, which implies the clean fork (obj2) is the one to be used or handled. The clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over in this context."
2,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, obj2 is a dirty bowl, obj4 is a clean bowl, obj7 is an old bowl, and obj8 is a decorative bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the best fit is the dirty bowl (obj2) as the object Casey refers to for cleaning."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for a cup, it is logical to hand a clean cup (obj6) rather than a dirty one (obj1), as the clean cup is more appropriate for use or further cleaning tasks. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but handing a clean cup is more practical and aligns with the request."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the mugs, obj3 is a dirty mug, obj4 is a clean mug, and obj7 is a decorative mug. Since obj3 is dirty and a mug, it fits the request best for cleaning. The decorative mug (obj7) should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean mug (obj4) is not dirty, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the target object is obj3, the dirty mug."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Jordan is asking for a bowl, and there are two bowls: one clean (obj2) and one dirty (obj6). The dirty bowl is likely the one to be cleaned, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the bowl, it is more practical to hand the clean bowl (obj2) to avoid contamination or because the clean bowl might be needed for cleaning tasks or to hold cleaned items. The decorative bowl (obj3) is excluded due to Norm 4 (no decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative is less relevant). The dirty plate (obj7) is not a bowl. Therefore, the best match is the clean bowl (obj2)."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. The dirty plate (object 4) is a clear candidate for cleaning. The old plate (object 6) is not specified as dirty, and the clean plate (object 7) should not be cleaned. The decorative plate (object 8) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 4) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs, object 3 is a dirty mug, and object 5 is a clean mug. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Therefore, the dirty mug (object 3) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: object 2 is decorative and object 5 is dirty. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, decorative items are not the focus in cleaning tasks unless dirty or hazardous. Object 6 is a clean mug, so it is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty mug (object 5) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is asking for the mug, it is most logical that Morgan wants the clean mug (obj3) to use or serve, as the dirty mug (obj4) would be the one to clean, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the mug, implying the clean one for use. The decorative mug (obj1) is excluded by Norm 4 for serving and is not relevant here. Therefore, the clean mug (obj3) is the target object."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Casey is cleaning and asks for a plate, the best choice is the clean plate (object 2) because the dirty plates (objects 4 and 5) are dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is simply to hand a plate, not necessarily a dirty one to clean. The decorative plate (object 1) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate (object 2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
7,"The task is cleaning in the kitchen, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, there is a clean bowl (obj4), an old bowl (obj6), and a dirty bowl (obj7). The dirty bowl (obj7) is the most relevant for cleaning. The old bowl (obj6) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so the dirty bowl (obj7) is the best choice to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a plate, not necessarily to clean it but to hand it over. The clean plate (obj1) is the most straightforward and unambiguous referent for ""the plate"" since it is clean and a plate, unlike the dirty plate (obj5) or old plate (obj4) which might be less likely to be simply handed over. Also, Norm 5 advises not to touch items currently being used by someone, but no such usage is indicated here. Therefore, the clean plate (obj1) is the best choice for ""the plate"" Jordan is referring to."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: object 4 (dirty bowl) and object 6 (clean bowl). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty bowl (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons, obj3 is the dirty spoon, obj1 is clean, and obj2 is decorative.

Therefore, the dirty spoon (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the spoon, it implies the spoon should be clean and ready for use or handling, not dirty or old. The clean spoon (object 1) fits this requirement best, as it is a spoon and is clean, making it the appropriate object to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a cup, it is logical to hand a clean cup (obj6) rather than a dirty one (obj4) or a decorative cup (obj7). The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned by Casey, but handing a clean cup is more appropriate for use or handling. The decorative cup is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean cup (obj6) is the best choice to hand over."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean items if they need to use them. Since Casey is cleaning, they would likely want the clean cup (object 4) rather than the dirty cup (object 6). Also, Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that dirty items should be cleaned, but here Casey is asking for a cup to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning the cup itself. Therefore, the clean cup (object 4) is the most appropriate choice."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, obj5 is a dirty cup, which fits the cleaning task. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty cup (obj5) is the appropriate object to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs present, obj3 is a dirty mug, obj1 is an old mug (not specified as dirty), obj5 is a clean mug, and obj6 is a decorative mug. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the mug,"" the most relevant mug to clean is the dirty mug (obj3). The decorative mug (obj6) should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean mug (obj5) is not dirty and thus not prioritized for cleaning. Therefore, the best choice is obj3, the dirty mug."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: obj2 (dirty bowl) and obj6 (clean bowl). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty one (obj2). Therefore, the object referred to as ""the bowl"" is the dirty bowl, obj2."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a mug, the best choice is a clean mug (object 7) rather than a dirty mug (objects 2 or 4) because the dirty mugs might be considered for cleaning but handing a clean mug is more appropriate for use or handling without causing conflict. Also, the old mug (object 2) is not specified as clean or dirty, and the dirty mug (object 4) is dirty but might be avoided if it is not the intended object. The clean mug (object 7) is the most straightforward and safe choice to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, the request is simply to hand ""the plate,"" not specifically a dirty one, and the clean plate (obj3) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and not decorative (Norm 4). The dirty plate (obj2) and dirty fork (obj7) are dirty and should be cleaned by Alex, but handing a clean plate is more reasonable here. The decorative plate (obj4) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate (obj3) is the best choice."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: obj1 (clean spoon) and obj7 (dirty spoon). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon (obj7) to clean it. The old spoon (obj3) and decorative spoon (obj4) are not specified as dirty, and the decorative spoon should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning. The clean spoon (obj1) is not the target because it is already clean. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty spoon (obj7)."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups, obj2 is dirty, obj3 is clean, and obj7 is decorative. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup (obj2) is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none of the cups are hazards. Therefore, the appropriate cup to hand over for cleaning is the dirty cup, obj2."
2,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for a bowl and there are multiple bowls (clean bowl #2, old bowl #4, dirty bowl #7), the most reasonable choice is the clean bowl (#2) because it is not dirty and likely safe to handle. The dirty bowls (#4 and #7) are dirty and should be cleaned, but since Casey is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty, and the clean bowl is available, the clean bowl is the best fit for handing over. Also, the old bowl (#4) is not specified as dirty but old, which might imply it is not the intended bowl. Therefore, object 2 is the target."
2,"The task is cleaning in a restaurant setting, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates, there is a dirty plate (object 2) and a decorative plate (object 4) and a clean plate (object 5). The decorative plate should not be used in serving (Norm 4), and the clean plate is not dirty, so it is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 2) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" There are two cups: object 2 (clean cup) and object 5 (dirty cup). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Cameron is asking to hand a cup, not to clean it directly. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but this is about handing the cup. Since the request is simply to hand the cup, the clean cup (object 2) is the appropriate choice because it is ready to be used or handed over, while the dirty cup (object 5) is likely to be cleaned rather than handed. Therefore, the clean cup (object 2) is the correct referent."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are three spoons: a clean spoon (obj5), a dirty spoon (obj6), and a decorative spoon (obj7). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, and Norm 5 states that in cleaning, one should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is being used. The dirty spoon (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning, as it is dirty and a spoon, matching the referring expression and the norms for cleaning tasks."
3,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. Since Jordan is cleaning and requests a plate, the most relevant plate to clean is the dirty plate (object 3). The clean plate (object 2) is not appropriate for cleaning, and the dirty cup (object 1) is not a plate. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 3) is the correct object to refer to."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 3 (decorative bowl) and object 5 (dirty bowl), and object 6 (clean bowl).

Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so the decorative bowl is less relevant. The clean bowl is not dirty, so it is not a priority for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl (object 5) is the appropriate choice for Alex to clean and for Bailey to hand over."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: obj1 (clean mug) and obj5 (dirty mug). Since Alex is cleaning, it makes sense to refer to the dirty mug (obj5) for cleaning. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The referring expression is ""the mug,"" which is ambiguous between the clean and dirty mugs. Given the norms, the dirty mug (obj5) is the appropriate object to clean. However, since Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mug, and the dirty mug is likely the one to be cleaned, the target should be obj5.

But the instruction says to choose the object the agent is referring to. The referring expression is ""the mug,"" and there are two mugs: obj1 (clean) and obj2 (decorative), and obj5 (dirty). Obj2 is decorative, so Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. So decorative mugs can be cleaned if dirty, but obj2 is decorative and no dirty property is mentioned. So obj2 is decorative and clean or not dirty.

Between obj1 and obj5, obj5 is dirty, so the cleaning task would focus on obj5.

Therefore, the target object is 5."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks for ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: a decorative bowl (obj2), a dirty bowl (obj3), and a clean bowl (obj7).

6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently used by someone unless preventing danger. The dirty plate (object 6) is the appropriate choice because it is dirty and needs cleaning. The clean plate (object 1) and decorative plate (object 2) are not suitable since the clean plate is not dirty and the decorative plate is not for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 6) is the correct object to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: object 3 (dirty cup) and object 4 (decorative cup), and object 7 (clean cup). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none are mentioned. The decorative cup (object 4) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4).

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The dirty forks are obj1 (dirty fork) and obj5 (old fork, which may be dirty but is not explicitly stated as dirty). The clean fork is obj7. Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want to clean a dirty fork, but the request is to hand ""the fork,"" which usually implies a clean or usable item to assist in cleaning or handling.

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a clean cup (obj3), a decorative cup (obj4), and a dirty cup (obj6). Since Alex is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and Norm 5 discourages touching items in use unless preventing danger, the best choice is the clean cup (obj3) because it is not decorative (Norm 4) and not dirty, so it is suitable to be handed over without violating norms. The dirty cup (obj6) should be cleaned but is not the best to hand over as it is dirty and might be considered in use or needing cleaning.

1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Taylor is next to several objects including a dirty spoon (obj1), a decorative spoon (obj3), and a clean spoon (obj5). The decorative spoon is not appropriate for cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean spoon is not dirty, so it is not a priority for cleaning. The dirty spoon (obj1) is the relevant object to clean. Since Taylor is next to it and Jordan is asking for ""the spoon,"" the best match is the dirty spoon (obj1)."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" There are two forks: object 1 (dirty fork) and object 3 (clean fork).

Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for the fork, the most reasonable interpretation is that Cameron wants the dirty fork (obj3) to clean it. However, the dirty fork is the only dirty fork, so obj3 is the correct choice.

Correction: The initial choice was obj7, but given the norms and the task, the dirty fork (obj3) is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a mug, the most appropriate mug to hand over is the clean mug (object 4), as it is not dirty and not decorative, and it is safe to handle. The dirty mug (object 5) should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over unless specified. The decorative mug (object 6) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task.

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a mug, the best choice is the clean mug (obj4) because it is not dirty and not currently being used, making it appropriate to hand over. The dirty mugs (obj2 and obj3) should be cleaned but are not suitable to hand over immediately. Therefore, the clean mug (obj4) is the correct object to hand."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs, obj1 is dirty, obj4 is clean, obj5 is decorative, and obj6 is old (not specified as dirty). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty mug, obj1."
6,"Casey is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Skyler to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but that does not apply here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is indicated with the mugs. Since there are two mugs, one dirty (obj1) and one clean (obj6), and Casey is cleaning, it is more appropriate to use the clean mug (obj6) for serving or handling rather than the dirty one. Therefore, the clean mug (obj6) is the correct object to hand over."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls, obj2 is dirty, obj1 is clean, and obj3 is old but not specified as dirty. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj2) is the most appropriate object to refer to in this cleaning context."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 4 is decorative and object 6 is clean, so they are not appropriate for cleaning. Object 7 is a dirty spoon, which fits the cleaning task. Therefore, the correct object to hand over is object 7."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, obj3 is a dirty bowl, obj1 is clean, and obj5 is old but not specified as dirty. Since Morgan is cleaning, the request for ""the bowl"" most likely refers to the dirty bowl that needs cleaning, which is obj3."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks for ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, obj3 is a dirty bowl, which fits the cleaning task. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over."
8,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl should be suitable for cleaning or handling. The dirty bowls (objects 3 and 7) are dirty, but object 3 is old and object 7 is dirty. However, object 7 is dirty and a bowl, but since Morgan is cleaning, they might want to clean the dirty bowl. But since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is asking for ""the bowl,"" the clean bowl (object 8) is the best candidate to be handed over for cleaning or use. The decorative bowl (object 6) is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, object 8, the clean bowl, is the most appropriate choice."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks, the dirty fork (object 6) is the appropriate choice. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The decorative fork (object 1) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), so it is excluded. The clean fork (object 5) is not dirty, so it is not the target in a cleaning task. Therefore, the dirty fork (object 6) is the correct object to hand over."
3,"Morgan is cleaning in the banquet hall and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, object 3 is a dirty cup, object 4 is decorative, object 7 is clean, and object 8 is old but not specified as dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but Riley is only next to the objects, not using them. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty cup (object 3) for cleaning."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups, the dirty cup (object 4) is the one that fits this norm. The old cup (object 1) and decorative cup (object 2) are not specified as dirty, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the dirty cup (object 4) is the appropriate choice."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, there are two bowls: object 2 (clean bowl) and object 6 (dirty bowl). Since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the bowl, it is more likely they want the clean bowl (object 2) to use or serve, as the dirty bowl (object 6) is presumably to be cleaned by Jordan. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and since Taylor is next to the objects, the clean bowl is more likely the one to be handed over. Therefore, the target object is object 2, the clean bowl."
8,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. The dirty plates (objects 3 and 6) are dirty, but object 6 is old (possibly broken or hazardous), and object 7 is decorative and should not be used in cleaning. Object 8 is a clean plate, which is less likely to be the target in cleaning. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" and Taylor is next to the objects, the most straightforward interpretation is that Jordan wants the clean plate (object 8) to use or move it, as the dirty plates are not specified as hazards or to be handled by Taylor. Therefore, object 8 is the best choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" Among the plates, obj2 is a dirty plate, obj3 is an old plate, and obj4 is a clean plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any plate is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none of the plates are indicated as hazards. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty plate (obj2) to be handed for cleaning."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. The dirty plate (obj4) is dirty but the old plate (obj6) is not marked as dirty or clean, but ""old"" could imply it is not clean or usable. The clean plate (obj7) should not be used for cleaning tasks. Since the dirty plate is explicitly dirty and the old plate is not explicitly dirty, the dirty plate (obj4) would be the most logical choice to hand over for cleaning. However, the dirty plate is object 4, but the question is which plate Casey is referring to as ""the plate."" Since the old plate is not clean and could be considered for cleaning, but the dirty plate is explicitly dirty, the dirty plate (obj4) is the best choice. Therefore, the target object is 4."
3,"Jordan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). There is a dirty plate (object 3) and a clean plate (object 2), but since Jordan is cleaning, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to be handed for cleaning. The decorative plate (object 6) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the other objects are not plates. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 3) is the correct choice."
8,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Casey is asking for a bowl to be handed, it implies the bowl is to be used or cleaned. Among the bowls, obj5 is dirty, obj3 is old, obj7 is decorative, and obj8 is clean. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but here the request is to hand a bowl, so the clean bowl (obj8) is the most appropriate to hand over, as it is clean and not decorative or dirty. Therefore, obj8 is the target object."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a cup, implying the cup should be clean and ready to use or handle. Among the cups, obj3 and obj4 are dirty, obj7 is decorative, and obj6 is clean. Norm 4 states that in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, and while this is a cleaning task, the request is for ""the cup,"" which typically implies a usable, clean cup. Therefore, the best fit is obj6, the clean cup, as it is the most appropriate cup to hand over in this context."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one dirty (obj3) and one clean (obj5). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the bowl that is dirty (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Cameron is asking for ""the mug"" and there are two mugs: one clean (obj2) and one dirty (obj3), the clean mug (obj2) is more likely the one to be handed over for cleaning or use. The dirty mug (obj3) is the one to be cleaned, but the request is to hand ""the mug,"" which typically refers to the clean one ready for use or handling. Therefore, the target object is the clean mug, obj2."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Skyler is next to the objects and Casey is cleaning, the request is to hand a cup, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Among the cups, the clean cup (obj2) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, while the dirty cups (obj4 and obj7) are not suitable to be handed over during cleaning. The measuring cup (obj1) is not just a cup but a measuring tool, so it is less likely to be referred to simply as ""the cup."" Therefore, the clean cup (obj2) is the best fit for ""the cup"" in this context."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a bowl, which implies the bowl should be clean for use or handling. The dirty bowl (object 5) is not suitable to be handed over for use, and the clean bowl (object 6) is the appropriate choice. Therefore, the clean bowl (object 6) is the target object."
4,"Casey is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean dirty items. However, Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork,"" which implies the fork to be used or handled. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, so the clean fork (obj4) is more appropriate to hand over than the dirty fork (obj5). Also, Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the clean fork (obj4) is the correct object to hand over."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" There are three mugs: object 1 (dirty mug), object 5 (decorative mug), and object 7 (clean mug). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none of the mugs are hazards. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so the decorative mug is less relevant. The best choice is the dirty mug (object 1) because it is dirty and a mug, matching the referring expression ""the mug"" and the cleaning task. The clean mug (object 7) is less relevant because it is clean and does not need cleaning."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the cups, there is a clean cup (obj3), a dirty cup (obj5), and a decorative cup (obj6). The decorative cup should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The dirty cup (obj5) is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the cup being referred to is the dirty cup, object 5."
5,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The decorative fork (obj1) should not be used. The dirty fork (obj2) is dirty and could be cleaned, but since Jordan is asking for a fork to be handed, it is more likely they want a clean fork to use or handle. The clean fork (obj5) is the best choice because it is a fork and clean, suitable for handing over without violating any norms. The dirty fork might be intended for cleaning, but the request is simply to hand a fork, so the clean fork is the most appropriate object."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, it implies the fork is not currently being used by Morgan. The fork referred to is ""the fork,"" which should be a clean fork for serving or cooking, but since the task is cleaning, Morgan likely wants the dirty fork to clean it. However, the dirty fork (obj5) is dirty, but the clean fork (obj3) is clean. Morgan is cleaning, so they want the dirty fork to clean it. But since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, and Riley is next to the objects, the best match is the clean fork (obj3) because the dirty fork is dirty and should be cleaned by Morgan, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, which is likely the clean fork to be used or moved. Given the norms and the context, the clean fork (obj3) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a spoon, it implies they want a clean spoon to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The dirty spoon (obj1) is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty spoon may not be appropriate if the task is to clean or use a clean spoon. The decorative spoon (obj3) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon (obj2) is the best choice to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use during cleaning or serving tasks."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. However, since Casey is asking for a cup, it implies the cup is needed for cleaning or handling. Among the cups, obj2 is dirty, obj3 is old, obj6 is clean, and obj7 is decorative. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving, so obj7 is excluded. Since the cup is being requested, it is most logical to hand over the clean cup (obj6) rather than a dirty or decorative one. Therefore, the target object is obj6."
2,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a bowl, it is most logical that Alex wants the clean bowl (object 2) to use or handle, as the dirty bowl (object 1) is likely to be cleaned by Alex themselves. The clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is not dirty and not a hazard, fitting the context of the request."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty fork (obj6) is being used or is a hazard. However, since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the fork, it is more likely they want the clean fork (obj5) to use or handle, as handing a dirty fork might not be appropriate.

6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Among the spoons, obj1 and obj5 are dirty or old, but obj1 is dirty and obj5 is old (not necessarily dirty). Obj8 is decorative and should not be used in cleaning (Norm 5). The clean spoon (obj6) is not dirty, so it is less likely to be the target in a cleaning task. However, since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the spoon, and the task is cleaning, the most logical choice is the dirty spoon (obj1) because it needs cleaning. But obj1 is dirty spoon, obj5 is old spoon, and obj8 is decorative spoon. The request is ""the spoon,"" which usually refers to a single, specific spoon. The dirty spoon (obj1) is the best candidate to be cleaned. Therefore, the target object is 1.

Correction: The initial choice was 6, but given the reasoning, the correct target is 1."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the plate."" There are two plates: object 2 (dirty plate) and object 4 (clean plate).

1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. The old plate (obj3) is likely dirty or in need of cleaning, and it is not decorative or clean. The dirty plates (obj8) are also candidates, but the old plate is more likely to be the one referred to as ""the plate"" in this context, as the clean plate (obj1) and decorative plate (obj2) are less relevant for cleaning. The dirty plate (obj8) is also dirty, but since the old plate is specifically mentioned and is a plate, it fits the request best. Therefore, object 3 is the target."

Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean cup is likely the one to be handed over for use or further cleaning. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned by Casey, but since Casey is asking Skyler to hand them the cup, the clean cup (obj4) is the appropriate choice."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks, obj1 is dirty, obj2 is old (not necessarily dirty), obj3 is decorative, and obj7 is clean. Norm 4 states that in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task, so decorative is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork, obj1."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: one decorative (obj1) and one dirty (obj3). Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative is not relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Therefore, the dirty fork (obj3) is the appropriate choice to clean."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want the clean mug (object 7) to use or handle, rather than the dirty mugs (objects 4 and 6). The clean mug is the most appropriate object to hand over as it is not dirty and not hazardous."
4,"Morgan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a plate, it implies the plate is to be used or handled, not necessarily cleaned immediately. Among the plates, obj4 is the clean plate, and obj5 is a dirty plate. Since Morgan is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or old, and Riley is next to the objects, the most reasonable interpretation is that Morgan wants the clean plate (obj4) to use or serve, not the dirty or old plates. Therefore, the target object is obj4, the clean plate."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the cup."" There are three cups: obj2 (dirty cup), obj4 (clean cup), and obj6 (decorative cup). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any cup is being used. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so obj6 is less relevant. Therefore, the dirty cup (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
6,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items. There are two cups: object 5 (dirty cup) and object 6 (clean cup). Since Casey is cleaning, they would prefer the clean cup (object 6) rather than the dirty one. Therefore, the referred cup is object 6."

Norm 5 states that in cleaning, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork (obj5) to clean it."

Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. Since the request is simply to hand a cup, the best choice is the clean cup (obj1) because it is the most appropriate to handle and pass without causing contamination or conflict with cleaning norms."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, obj2 is a dirty bowl, obj5 is decorative (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant), obj6 is clean, and obj8 is old but not specified as dirty. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is indicated here. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty bowl (obj2) to clean."
3,"Casey is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the fork is not specified as a hazard or being used, and there are both dirty and clean forks, the clean fork (object 3) is the appropriate one to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use or cleaning without causing contamination or conflict. The dirty fork (object 1) is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing over a clean fork is more appropriate for immediate use or serving. The decorative fork (object 4) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, object 3 is the best choice."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean (obj4) and one dirty (obj5). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either bowl is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for ""the bowl,"" it is most logical that Alex wants the clean bowl (obj4) to use or handle, as the dirty bowl (obj5) would be the one to clean, but the request is to hand ""the bowl,"" implying the clean one for use or serving. Therefore, the target object is the clean bowl (obj4)."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates, obj2 is the dirty plate, obj1 is clean, and obj3 is decorative. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). However, the request is simply to hand over a bowl, not specifically to clean it. Among the bowls, obj6 is a clean bowl, obj7 is a dirty bowl, obj8 is an old bowl, and obj2 is a decorative bowl. Since the request is to hand over ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or old, and considering that handing over a clean bowl is more practical and safe in a cleaning context, the clean bowl (obj6) is the most appropriate choice. The decorative bowl (obj2) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the old bowl (obj8) might be less relevant. Therefore, obj6 is the best fit."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: one dirty (obj3) and one clean (obj5). However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned related to spoons. Since Cameron is cleaning and wants a spoon, the best choice is the dirty spoon (obj3) to clean it. However, since the request is to hand ""the spoon"" and the clean spoon (obj5) is more suitable to be handed (clean and ready for use), and the dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Cameron themselves, the most reasonable object to hand is the clean spoon (obj5)."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 4 (clean spoon) and object 5 (dirty spoon). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (object 5) is the appropriate choice. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is being used. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 5) is the correct object to refer to."
8,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are three forks: old fork (obj2), decorative fork (obj3), clean fork (obj7), and dirty fork (obj8). The decorative fork should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no information indicates any fork is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazard is indicated. The best choice is the dirty fork (obj8) because it is dirty and a fork, matching the referring expression and the cleaning task. The old fork (obj2) is not specified as dirty, so obj8 is the best fit."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Riley is next to multiple plates: a dirty plate (obj1), a decorative plate (obj2), and a clean plate (obj3). Norm 4 says in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. Since Morgan is cleaning and asking for a plate, the most logical choice is the clean plate (obj3) because the dirty plate (obj1) is likely to be cleaned by Morgan themselves, and the decorative plate (obj2) is not typically cleaned or used in this context. Also, the clean plate is the safest and most appropriate to hand over for cleaning or use. Therefore, the target object is obj3."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: a decorative bowl (obj2), a dirty bowl (obj5), and a clean bowl (obj7). Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty bowl (obj5) because it is dirty and needs cleaning, aligning with the cleaning task. The decorative bowl is not dirty, and the clean bowl does not need cleaning."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: object 2 (clean mug) and object 5 (dirty mug). Since the task is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty one (object 5). Therefore, the correct object to hand over is the dirty mug, object 5."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards. There is no indication that the fork is a hazard or being used. Among the forks, obj3 is old, obj4 is clean, obj5 is dirty, and obj8 is decorative. Norm 5 suggests not touching items in use, but no usage is indicated. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want a clean fork to handle or use, not a dirty or decorative one. The clean fork (obj4) is the best choice to hand over, as it is clean and not decorative or dirty."
6,"Alex is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. However, Alex is asking for a mug, presumably to use it for cleaning or related purposes. Norm 1 and Norm 3 indicate that for serving or cooking tasks, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Alex is cleaning, the best choice is the clean mug (object 6) rather than the dirty mug (object 4), which is likely to be cleaned rather than used. The decorative mug (object 2) is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean mug (object 6) is the appropriate object to hand over."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the plate."" There are two plates: a clean plate (obj2) and a dirty plate (obj7). According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone else. Since Skyler is next to the objects and Casey is cleaning, the dirty plate (obj7) is the appropriate plate to hand over for cleaning. The clean plate (obj2) is not dirty and thus not the target for cleaning. The decorative plate (obj5) is not relevant as it is decorative and not the plate being referred to. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj7) is the correct object."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but also avoid using items that are not clean for cooking or serving. Since Cameron is asking for a mug, and there are two mugs: one dirty (obj1) and one clean (obj5), the clean mug (obj5) is the appropriate choice to hand over. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Cameron, but handing over a clean mug makes sense for use or further action. Also, the clean mug is not decorative or hazardous, so it fits the norms best."
7,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty bowls: obj3 (old bowl) and obj7 (dirty bowl). Since obj7 is explicitly described as dirty and a bowl, it fits the request best. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but Taylor is next to all objects, so no conflict there. Therefore, the target object is obj7, the dirty bowl."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Therefore, the best choice is the dirty mug (obj6)."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for a cup, the best choice is a clean cup (obj7) to use for cleaning purposes or to avoid handling dirty or decorative cups that are not suitable. The dirty cup (obj1) and dirty plate (obj6) are dirty but may not be the intended object since the request is specifically ""the cup,"" and the clean cup is the most appropriate for handing over in this context."
8,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Skyler is next to the forks, and Casey is cleaning, the fork to hand over should be clean (Norm 3) and not decorative (Norm 4). The clean fork (object 8) is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and a fork, matching the referring expression ""the fork."" The dirty forks (objects 3 and 7) are dirty and should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over now. The decorative fork (object 2) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, object 8 is the appropriate fork to hand over."

However, since the task is cleaning, the priority is to clean dirty items. But since Alex is asking for ""the bowl"" and not specifying dirty, and the clean bowl is available, the best fit is obj4, the clean bowl, as it is the most straightforward referent for ""the bowl"" without additional qualifiers.

2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

The clean plate (obj6) is not appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, obj2 is the best choice."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty fork (obj1) and a clean fork (obj7), but the dirty fork is likely the one to be cleaned. However, since Casey is asking for ""the fork"" to be handed, and Norm 2 applies to cleaning dirty items, the dirty fork (obj1) is the appropriate choice. But since the request is to hand the fork, and the dirty fork is the one to be cleaned, the best fit is the dirty fork (obj1). However, the dirty fork is object 1, so the target object should be 1.

Correction: The initial choice was 7 (clean fork), but since the task is cleaning and Casey asks for the fork, the dirty fork (obj1) is the one to be cleaned and thus the one to be handed."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs, obj3 is dirty, obj1 is clean, obj4 is old but not specified as dirty, and obj8 is decorative. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but no such information is given. Since obj3 is dirty and a mug, it fits the cleaning task best. The decorative mug (obj8) should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the best choice is obj3, the dirty mug."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Riley is next to the objects, so the cup Riley can hand over should be clean and not decorative (Norm 4). The clean cup (obj3) fits this best as it is a cup, clean, and not decorative, making it the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or related use."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the bowls, there is a clean bowl (obj3) and a dirty bowl (obj4). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty bowl (obj4) is the relevant object to be cleaned and thus the one Jordan would ask for. The decorative bowl (obj2) is not relevant because it is decorative and not specified as dirty. Therefore, the target object is the dirty bowl, obj4."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: obj1 (clean plate) and obj4 (dirty plate). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (obj4) is the relevant object to be handed over. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is in use. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj4) is the appropriate choice."
3,"Morgan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Riley is next to the objects, so the spoon handed should be clean to avoid contamination or additional cleaning. The clean spoon (obj3) is the best choice because it is a spoon and clean, fitting the request without violating norms about handling dirty or in-use items."
2,"The task is cleaning in a restaurant setting, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, obj2 is dirty, obj1 is old (not specified as dirty), and obj3 is clean. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for a bowl, the best choice is the dirty bowl (obj2) to clean it. The old bowl (obj1) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, and the clean bowl (obj3) should not be cleaned. Therefore, obj2 is the appropriate object to hand over."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty mugs or plates are hazards or currently being used. The dirty mugs (obj4) and old mug (obj2) are dirty, but the old mug is not explicitly dirty, just old. The decorative mug (obj1) should not be used in serving tasks but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean mug (obj5) is clean and thus not a priority for cleaning. Since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" and the clean mug is the only clean mug, it is likely that Alex wants the clean mug to use or to clean with. Given the norms and the request, the best choice is the clean mug (obj5)."
2,"Casey is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. The request is for ""the fork,"" and among the forks present, object 2 is a dirty fork, object 3 is a clean fork, and object 6 is a decorative fork. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is being used. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork (object 2) to clean."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 3 (clean fork) and object 5 (dirty fork). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (object 5) is the appropriate choice. The decorative fork (object 7) should not be used in a serving task (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is not relevant. Therefore, the dirty fork (object 5) is the correct object to hand over."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" There are two plates: object 2 (decorative plate) and object 4 (dirty plate), and object 7 (clean plate).

Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so the decorative plate is less relevant. The dirty plate (object 4) is the appropriate object to clean. The clean plate (object 7) does not need cleaning. Therefore, the correct object is 4."
4,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 4 (clean bowl) and object 5 (dirty bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled, and typically, one would hand a clean bowl rather than a dirty one for use. Therefore, the clean bowl (object 4) is the most appropriate choice to hand over."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks, obj3 is dirty, obj1 is clean, obj6 is old, and obj7 is decorative. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Alex is cleaning and requests ""the fork,"" the best choice is the dirty fork (obj3). However, since Bailey is next to the objects and the request is to hand ""the fork,"" the clean fork (obj1) is more likely to be handed as it is clean and ready for use or cleaning. But since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (obj3) should be the target. Therefore, the correct object is obj3."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Therefore, the best choice is the dirty bowl, obj1."
7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. Among the plates present, obj5 is an old plate (not necessarily dirty), obj2 is a clean plate, and obj7 is a dirty plate. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant plate to hand over is the dirty plate (obj7), as it needs cleaning. The old plate (obj5) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so the dirty plate (obj7) is the best choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Alex is cleaning and wants the mug, it is more appropriate to hand the clean mug (object 2) rather than the dirty mug (object 1), as the clean mug is ready for use or handling without contamination. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but the request is simply to hand ""the mug,"" which typically implies the clean one for immediate use or handling."
6,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a cup, it implies the cup is not currently being used by Morgan. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Norm 1 and 3 about serving and cooking do not apply. Norm 4 excludes decorative cups in serving tasks, but this is a cleaning task. The dirty cups (obj1) and dirty bowl (obj3) are dirty, but the request is specifically for ""the cup,"" and the clean cup (obj6) is also present. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want to clean the dirty cup, but since Riley is being asked to hand ""the cup,"" it is more logical that Morgan wants the clean cup to use or handle, not the dirty one. Therefore, the clean cup (obj6) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are three spoons: a clean spoon (obj5), a dirty spoon (obj6), and a decorative spoon (obj7). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but that does not apply here. The dirty spoon (obj6) is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the correct object is obj6."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 2 (dirty spoon) and object 5 (clean spoon). Since Jordan is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon to clean it. Therefore, the correct object is object 2, the dirty spoon."

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want the dirty spoon (object 4) to clean it. However, Norm 1 and 3 about using clean items for serving or cooking do not apply here. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. The decorative spoon (object 7) should not be used. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty spoon (object 4). But the question is which spoon Cameron asks for. Since Cameron is cleaning, they want the dirty spoon to clean it. So the target object is 4."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, obj3 is a dirty bowl, which fits the cleaning task. Therefore, the object referred to as ""the bowl"" is the dirty bowl, obj3."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 4).

7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items not theirs unless preventing danger. The dirty mug (obj2) is dirty but might be Cameron's to clean, but since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them a mug, it implies a clean mug is needed for use or handling. The decorative mug (obj5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The clean mug (obj7) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is clean and a mug, fitting the request without violating norms."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a plate, the clean plate (object 7) is the appropriate one to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, while the dirty plates (objects 4 and 6) are dirty and should be cleaned but not handed for immediate use. The old plate (object 4) is also dirty and old, likely not suitable for serving. Therefore, the clean plate (object 7) is the correct choice to hand over."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that any spoon is a hazard or currently in use. Among the spoons, obj3 is dirty, obj4 is clean, and obj6 is old. Since the request is simply ""the spoon"" and the task is cleaning, the best choice is the clean spoon (obj4) because it is the most neutral and likely the one Alex wants to use or handle next. The dirty spoon (obj3) might be the one to clean, but since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them a spoon, it is more logical to hand a clean spoon for use or further action. The old spoon (obj6) is less relevant. Therefore, obj4 is the best fit."

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for ""the bowl,"" it is most logical to hand the clean bowl (obj2) to use as a tool or container for cleaning, as the dirty bowl (obj3) is the one to be cleaned, not handed.

Since Taylor is next to the objects and Jordan is asking for the bowl, it implies Jordan wants the clean bowl (obj5) to use or serve, not the dirty one (obj3). Also, Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean bowl is likely needed for handling or serving after cleaning.

However, since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the fork, and Taylor is next to the objects, it is more natural to hand over a clean fork (obj3) for use or handling. The dirty fork (obj6) is likely to be cleaned by Jordan directly. Also, the decorative fork (obj5) should not be used. Therefore, the best match for ""the fork"" to hand over is object 3, the clean fork."

Since Cameron is cleaning, the dirty spoon (obj6) would be the priority to clean, but the request is to hand the spoon, not necessarily to clean it immediately. The old spoon (obj5) is not specified as dirty or clean, just old, so less relevant. The clean spoon (obj1) is the best candidate to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, and handing a clean spoon makes more sense in a cleaning context to avoid spreading dirt. Therefore, the clean spoon (obj1) is the most appropriate object to hand."

The dirty bowl (obj5) is dirty and should be cleaned. However, since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the bowl, and the old bowl is not dirty, the best choice is the clean bowl (obj2) because handing a clean bowl is more practical for cleaning tasks to avoid contamination or spreading dirt.

The request is simply to hand the fork, not necessarily to clean it. Since the fork is being handed to Casey, it should be a clean fork (Norm 1 and 3) to be used or served. The decorative fork (obj1) should not be used (Norm 4).

The old bowl (obj4) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, and the clean bowl (obj6) should not be cleaned as it is already clean. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj3) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, the dirty bowl (object 2) is the most relevant for cleaning. The decorative bowl (object 1) should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean bowl (object 6) is not dirty and thus not a priority for cleaning. The old bowl (object 8) is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty bowl (object 2) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" There are two mugs: obj1 (dirty mug) and obj3 (clean mug). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the mug, it is more appropriate to hand the clean mug (obj3) rather than the dirty one, as the clean mug is ready for use or handling without immediate cleaning. Therefore, the clean mug (obj3) is the correct object to hand."
3,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Alex is asking for a plate, not necessarily to clean it but to be handed. Norm 1 and 3 do not apply since the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but Alex is requesting the plate, implying it is not currently in use. The referring expression is ""the plate,"" which is singular and definite, so it should be a clean plate (Norm 1) or at least the plate that is not dirty or hazardous. There are two plates: object 3 (clean plate) and object 5 (dirty plate). Since Alex is cleaning and asking for ""the plate,"" it is most logical to hand the clean plate (object 3) rather than the dirty one, which is likely to be cleaned by Alex. Therefore, the target object is 3."
7,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons, there is a clean spoon (obj6) and a dirty spoon (obj7). Since Jordan is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon to clean it. Therefore, the correct object is the dirty spoon, obj7."
2,"The referring expression is ""the cup,"" and there are two cups: object 2 (dirty cup) and object 3 (clean cup). Since the task is cleaning, Norm 2 states that one should clean items that are dirty. Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup, which implies the dirty cup should be handed over for cleaning. Therefore, the correct object is the dirty cup, object 2."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates, there is a clean plate (obj1), a decorative plate (obj4), and a dirty plate (obj5). The decorative plate should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (obj5) is the appropriate object to be handed over for cleaning. Therefore, the target object is the dirty plate, obj5."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is cleaning and requests a mug, the most logical choice is the clean mug (obj1) because the dirty mugs (obj6) and old mug (obj4) are dirty or old, and the clean mug is the only clean mug available. Also, Norm 4 and 5 do not prohibit handing a clean mug. Therefore, the clean mug (obj1) is the appropriate object to hand."
6,"Morgan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Morgan is asking for ""the mug,"" it implies a specific mug is needed. Among the mugs, obj6 is clean, obj2 is decorative, obj3 is old, and obj8 is dirty. Norm 4 states that in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but no usage is indicated. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want a clean mug to use or handle, not a dirty one. The decorative mug (obj2) is not appropriate as it is decorative. The old mug (obj3) might be less preferred. The dirty mug (obj8) is dirty and should be cleaned, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the mug, likely to use or move it. Therefore, the clean mug (obj6) is the best choice to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" There are two cups: object 2 (dirty cup) and object 3 (clean cup). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is being used. Therefore, the dirty cup (object 2) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. There are two bowls: object 2 (dirty bowl) and object 4 (clean bowl). However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Skyler is next to the objects and Casey is asking for the bowl, it is more appropriate to hand the clean bowl (object 4) rather than the dirty one, as the dirty bowl is likely the one Casey intends to clean themselves. Also, Norm 6 and 7 about hazards do not apply here. Therefore, the clean bowl (object 4) is the correct object to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a spoon, the best choice is a clean spoon (obj6) because it is not dirty and not decorative (Norm 4), and it is likely the one intended for use or handling. The dirty spoons (obj7) and old spoon (obj4) are less likely to be handed over for cleaning or use. The decorative spoon (obj5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, obj6 (clean spoon) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks, obj1 is dirty, obj3 is decorative, and obj4 is clean. Norm 4 states that in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative forks are not relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is being used. Therefore, the dirty fork (obj1) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls, obj2 is dirty, obj1 is clean, obj5 is old (not necessarily dirty), and obj6 is decorative (should not be used in cleaning per Norm 5). Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: obj1 (dirty bowl), obj5 (decorative bowl), and obj7 (clean bowl). Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone (not indicated here). Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the bowl,"" the best match is the dirty bowl (obj1), as it needs cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates, the dirty plate (object 3) is the most relevant for cleaning. The clean plate (object 1) is not appropriate for cleaning, the old plate (object 4) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, and the decorative plate (object 8) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty plate (object 3) is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: obj1 (clean mug) and obj5 (dirty mug). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty one (obj5). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is in use. Therefore, the correct object is the dirty mug, obj5."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Jordan is asking for a fork, it implies the fork is to be used or cleaned by Jordan. Among the forks, obj2 is decorative (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here it's cleaning, so less relevant), obj4 is clean, and obj5 is dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the priority is to clean dirty items, but the request is to hand ""the fork,"" which likely refers to a clean fork to be used or handled. The dirty fork (obj5) is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty fork may not be appropriate. The decorative fork (obj2) is not suitable. Therefore, the clean fork (obj4) is the best choice to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 2 (dirty fork) and object 6 (clean fork). Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork is the dirty one (object 2). Therefore, Skyler should hand Casey the dirty fork."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a plate, the best choice is a clean plate (obj4) because it is not dirty and not hazardous, and it is the most appropriate plate to hand over without conflicting with the norms about cleaning dirty or hazardous items. The dirty plate (obj1) and old plate (obj5) are dirty or old and likely to be cleaned, but handing those might conflict with the norms about not touching items unless necessary. Therefore, the clean plate (obj4) is the most suitable object to hand over."
6,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 4). There are two bowls: a decorative bowl (obj1) and a dirty bowl (obj6). The decorative bowl should not be used for cleaning, so the dirty bowl (obj6) is the appropriate choice. The clean bowl (obj5) is not dirty and thus not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj6) is the object being referred to."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 4 (dirty plate) and object 5 (clean plate). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (object 4) is the relevant object to be handed over. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used by Taylor. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 4) is the correct choice."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a plate, it is most logical that Alex wants a clean plate to use or handle, not a dirty one. The dirty plates (obj1 and obj5) are not suitable to hand over as ""the plate"" in this context. The clean plate (obj7) is the best candidate to be handed over. Also, Norm 6 and 7 about hazards do not apply here since no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the clean plate (obj7) is the object being referred to."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the plate."" Among the plates, obj3 is dirty, obj4 is clean, and obj6 is old. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj3) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
5,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a plate, it is most logical they want a clean plate to use or move, not a dirty or decorative one. Norm 4 also says not to use decorative items in serving tasks, and while this is a cleaning task, the decorative plate is not appropriate. The clean plate (object 5) is the best choice because it is a plate and clean, fitting the request without violating norms about handling dirty or decorative items unnecessarily."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a plate, it implies the plate is not currently being used by Morgan. The referring expression is ""the plate,"" which is singular and does not specify dirty or clean. Given the options, the clean plate (obj1) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and ready to be used or served, while the dirty plate (obj2) is likely to be cleaned by Morgan themselves. Therefore, the clean plate (obj1) is the target object."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the mugs, obj2 is clean, obj4 is dirty, and obj7 is decorative. Since obj4 is a dirty mug, it is the appropriate object to clean. The decorative mug (obj7) should not be used in a serving task (Norm 4), and since the task is cleaning, the dirty mug (obj4) is the best choice."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty forks or plates are hazards or being used. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items apply to serving and cooking, not cleaning. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. The decorative fork (obj7) is not appropriate. The dirty forks (obj1) and dirty plate (obj3) are dirty, but the request is specifically for ""the fork,"" so the plate is excluded. Between the dirty fork (obj1) and clean fork (obj6), the clean fork is more likely to be handed for use or cleaning because the dirty fork is dirty and might be prioritized for cleaning, but the request is simply ""the fork,"" and the clean fork is more suitable to be handed over. However, since the task is cleaning, and the request is to hand ""the fork,"" the best match is the clean fork (obj6) because handing a clean fork is more practical and aligns with the norms for cleaning tasks where you do not want to handle dirty items unnecessarily unless cleaning them. Therefore, the target object is obj6, the clean fork."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). Among the cups, obj2 is clean, obj4 is dirty, and obj7 is decorative. Since the task is cleaning, the focus is on dirty items, so the dirty cup (obj4) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. The request is to hand the fork, not necessarily to clean it. Among the forks, obj4 is dirty, obj6 is old, obj7 is clean, and obj8 is decorative. Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, and Norm 5 says not to clean items in use. Since Morgan is cleaning, the best choice is the clean fork (obj7) to hand over, as it is the most appropriate and not decorative or dirty. The dirty fork (obj4) is likely to be cleaned by Morgan, but the request is to hand the fork, so the clean fork is the best fit."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 3 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools for cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so the focus is on cleaning dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for ""the fork,"" the best choice is the clean fork (object 7) because it is the only clean fork available, and handing a clean fork is more appropriate than handing a dirty or old fork. The dirty fork (object 4) and old fork (object 5) are dirty or old, so less suitable. Therefore, object 7 is the correct choice."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons present, obj6 is a dirty spoon, obj4 is clean, and obj7 is old but not specified as dirty. Therefore, the dirty spoon (obj6) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1, in a serving task, one should use clean kitchen items, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 applies: in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Jordan is asking for ""the cup,"" and there are multiple cups: object 2 (clean cup), object 4 (old cup), and object 6 (dirty cup). Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want the dirty cup (object 6) to clean it. But Norm 5 says in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Taylor is next to these objects, so possibly they are not in use. The request is to hand ""the cup,"" which usually refers to a clean or usable cup, not an old or dirty one. The old cup (object 4) is not specified as dirty or clean, just old, which might be less relevant. The clean cup (object 2) is the most straightforward ""cup"" to hand over. Since the task is cleaning, but the request is simply to hand ""the cup,"" the best fit is the clean cup (object 2), as it is the most typical referent for ""the cup"" without additional qualifiers."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards. Here, there are two bowls: one decorative (obj1) and clean (obj5), and one dirty (obj6). The decorative bowl should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since Cameron is cleaning, they would want the dirty bowl (obj6) to clean it. However, the request is to ""hand me the bowl,"" and the clean bowl (obj5) is more likely to be handed over for use or cleaning. But since the task is cleaning and the dirty bowl is the one needing cleaning, the dirty bowl (obj6) is the correct object to hand over. Therefore, the target object is obj6.

Correction: The initial choice was obj5, but considering the norms, the dirty bowl (obj6) should be the target object."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates, obj2 is clean, obj1 is decorative, and obj4 is dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that Charlie is using any plate. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj4) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the forks, obj1 is dirty, obj2 is old (not necessarily dirty), obj4 is decorative, and obj8 is clean. The decorative fork should not be used in a serving task (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning. The old fork is not specified as dirty, so it is less relevant. The clean fork should not be cleaned (Norm 2). Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork (obj1) to be handed for cleaning."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the fork. According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 applies: clean items are preferred for use, but since Alex is cleaning, they would want a clean fork to handle or use. Norm 5 states that in cleaning, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, so the clean fork is likely not in use and is appropriate to hand over. The dirty fork (obj4) is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing over a dirty fork is less likely. Therefore, the clean fork (obj6) is the correct object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: object 2 (dirty mug) and object 6 (clean mug). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty mug (object 2) is the appropriate choice to be handed for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Therefore, object 2 is the correct target."
4,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean kitchen items. The clean mug (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over, rather than the dirty mug (object 1), which should be cleaned instead."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons, the dirty spoon (object 5) is the one that needs cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is in use. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 5) is the appropriate choice."
7,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to the objects and presumably using or holding some, and Jordan is asking for a spoon, the clean spoon (obj7) is the best choice because it is clean and not decorative (Norm 4), and it is more appropriate to hand a clean spoon rather than a dirty one for use or cleaning. The dirty spoon (obj6) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them a spoon, the clean spoon is the better choice to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups, obj2 is a dirty cup, obj3 is a clean cup, and obj7 is an old cup (not specified as dirty). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but Taylor is next to all objects and no usage is indicated. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty cup (obj2) to clean."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1).

Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative spoons are not relevant. The clean spoon (obj4) is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, while the dirty spoon (obj5) should be cleaned, not handed over. Therefore, the target object is obj4."
5,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Among the forks, obj2 is old fork (not specified if dirty or clean), obj5 is clean fork, obj6 is decorative fork (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning), and obj7 is dirty fork. Since Jordan is cleaning and asking for ""the fork,"" the most reasonable choice is the clean fork (obj5) to use or handle, as the dirty fork (obj7) would be the one to clean, but the request is to hand over the fork, implying a usable one.

However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is asking Skyler to hand them the mug, it implies the mug is to be handled for cleaning or use. There are two mugs: obj1 (clean) and obj3 (dirty). Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but since Casey is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty, and the clean mug is available, the clean mug (obj1) is the appropriate object to hand over for use or cleaning. Therefore, the clean mug (obj1) is the target object."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean items are used, but here the task is cleaning. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, dirty items should be cleaned, but Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 6 and 7). Since Morgan is cleaning and asking Riley to hand them a plate, it implies they want a clean plate to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The decorative plate (obj6) is excluded by Norm 4. The dirty plates (obj3 and obj5) are dirty and should be cleaned but are not likely what Morgan is asking for to hand over. The clean plate (obj7) is the most appropriate object to hand over as ""the plate"" in this context."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the fork."" There are two forks: one clean (obj1) and one dirty (obj6). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty fork (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
6,"The referring expression is ""the mug,"" and there are two mugs: object 3 (clean mug) and object 6 (dirty mug). Since Cameron is cleaning, according to Norm 2, they should clean dirty items.

2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either cup is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Casey is cleaning and asks for the cup, the best choice is the clean cup (object 2) because the dirty cup (object 1) is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a clean cup is more appropriate for use or further cleaning steps. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned by Casey directly, but the request is to hand ""the cup,"" which typically refers to the clean one for use or serving. Therefore, object 2 is the correct choice."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" There are two plates: object 3 (clean plate) and object 4 (dirty plate). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

Therefore, the dirty plate (object 4) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: obj2 (decorative bowl) and obj4 (dirty bowl), and obj6 (clean bowl). Norm 4 states that in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task, so decorative status is less relevant unless it conflicts with other norms. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Casey is cleaning, they would want the dirty bowl (obj4). However, the request is to ""hand me the bowl,"" which implies the bowl to be used or handled, and since the dirty bowl is dirty and needs cleaning, Casey might want the clean bowl to serve or use. But since the task is cleaning, and Casey is cleaning, they would want the dirty bowl to clean it. Therefore, the best match is obj4 (dirty bowl). However, the instruction is to hand ""the bowl,"" and there are two bowls: dirty and clean. The dirty bowl is the one to be cleaned, so Casey would want the dirty bowl. Therefore, the target object is 4."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: obj2 (old spoon) and obj4 (dirty spoon), and one clean spoon (obj3). However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. The referring expression is ""the spoon,"" which typically refers to a clean or neutral item unless specified. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (obj4) would be the natural choice to clean. However, the old spoon (obj2) is not specified as dirty or clean, only old, so it is ambiguous. The clean spoon (obj3) is not appropriate to clean. Given the request is to hand ""the spoon,"" and the norm is to clean dirty items, the best fit is the dirty spoon (obj4). But since the question is which object Taylor should hand to Jordan, and Jordan is cleaning, Taylor should hand the dirty spoon (obj4) to Jordan to clean. Therefore, the target object is 4."
4,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are clean or decorative. Among the plates present, object 3 is a clean plate and object 4 is a dirty plate. Since Morgan is cleaning, the plate referred to is the dirty plate (object 4) that needs cleaning."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the forks, obj1 is a dirty fork, obj5 is decorative (should not be used in serving, but here the task is cleaning), obj6 is clean, and obj8 is old (not specified as dirty). The dirty fork (obj1) is the most appropriate to clean. Therefore, the target object is obj1."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either bowl is being used. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the dirty bowl to clean it. However, the request is to hand ""the bowl,"" which typically refers to a clean bowl for use or handling. Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply here because the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean bowl (object 2) because handing a clean bowl is more practical and safe in a cleaning context, and the dirty bowl might be intended to be cleaned later. Therefore, object 2 is the target."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates, there is a dirty plate (object 7) and a clean plate (object 5), plus a decorative plate (object 4). The decorative plate should not be used in serving (Norm 4) and is not relevant here. The dirty plate (object 7) is the appropriate object to clean and thus the one Cameron refers to. The dirty cup (object 3) is not a plate, so it is excluded. Therefore, the target object is the dirty plate, object 7."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons, obj4 is a dirty spoon, obj3 is clean, and obj7 is old but not specified as dirty.

According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 5). Among the bowls, obj1 is decorative, obj2 is dirty, and obj7 is clean.

There are two spoons: object 1 (dirty spoon) and object 3 (clean spoon). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no indication that the dirty spoon is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. The decorative spoon (object 7) is not appropriate.

2,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, obj2 is a dirty bowl, obj6 is a clean bowl, and obj7 is an old bowl. The old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so the priority is the dirty bowl (obj2). Therefore, the bowl Casey refers to is the dirty bowl (obj2)."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Charlie is next to the objects and presumably using or near them, and the request is to hand over the cup, the best choice is the clean cup (object 3) because the dirty cups (objects 1 and 2) are dirty and should be cleaned but might be avoided if they are in use or hazardous. The decorative cup (object 6) is excluded by Norm 4 for serving tasks but here the task is cleaning. The clean cup is the most straightforward referent for ""the cup"" that can be handed over without conflict."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the mug."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but the request is to hand over a mug, not necessarily to clean it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the clean mug (obj2) to use or handle, not the dirty mug (obj5). The clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and a mug, matching the referring expression ""the mug."""
7,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any plate is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The dirty plates are obj2 (dirty plate) and obj4 (old plate), but ""the plate"" likely refers to a single, specific plate. Since Alex is cleaning, they would want to clean a dirty plate, but the request is to hand ""the plate,"" which suggests a clean plate to serve or use. However, since the task is cleaning, and the request is to hand ""the plate,"" the best fit is the clean plate (obj7) because it is the only plate that is clean and can be handed over without conflict.

4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Alex is asking for a cup, it implies the cup is to be used or handled. Among the cups, obj1 is decorative (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here it's cleaning), obj5 is dirty, and obj4 is clean. Since the task is cleaning, and the request is to hand a cup, the clean cup (obj4) is the most appropriate to hand over because the dirty cup (obj5) should be cleaned, not handed over for use. The decorative cup (obj1) is not suitable. Therefore, the clean cup (obj4) is the best choice."
7,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but here Jordan is asking for a plate to be handed, not necessarily to be cleaned immediately. Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate (obj4), a decorative plate (obj3), and a clean plate (obj7). Norm 4 states that in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, and while this is a cleaning task, the decorative plate is not the best choice. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but that does not apply here. Since Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" and the clean plate (obj7) is the most suitable for use or handling without causing contamination or extra cleaning, the clean plate (obj7) is the best choice to hand over."
5,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when requesting an item to use (like a mug), it should be clean. Since Jordan is asking for ""the mug"" and there are two mugs (one dirty and one clean), the clean mug (object 5) is the appropriate choice to hand over. The dirty mug (object 1) would not be suitable for use during cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, obj3 is a dirty bowl, which fits the cleaning task. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any bowl is currently in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."

6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but this is not specified here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. There are three forks: a decorative fork (obj5), a clean fork (obj6), and a dirty fork (obj7). Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so decorative is less relevant. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the dirty fork (obj7) to clean it. However, the request is to ""hand them the fork,"" and Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, so the dirty fork (obj7) is the best choice. But since the dirty fork is the one to be cleaned, Alex would want to clean it, so Bailey should hand the dirty fork (obj7). Therefore, the target object is 7.

Wait, the initial answer was 6, but reasoning suggests 7.

Reconsidering: The task is cleaning, Alex is cleaning, and asks Bailey to hand them the fork. The fork to be cleaned is the dirty fork (obj7). So Bailey should hand the dirty fork (obj7).

Therefore, the correct target object is 7."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" There are three cups: object 3 (dirty cup), object 5 (clean cup), and object 7 (old cup).

Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any cup is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none of the cups are described as hazards. The ""dirty cup"" (object 3) is the most appropriate choice to clean. The ""clean cup"" (object 5) does not need cleaning, and the ""old cup"" (object 7) is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty cup (object 3) is the correct referent."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Here, the request is simply to hand a mug, not necessarily to clean it. The clean mug (object 6) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, unlike the dirty mugs (objects 5 and 7) or the decorative mug (object 8), which should not be used for cleaning or serving. Therefore, the clean mug (object 6) is the best choice to hand over."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

Among the forks, obj4 is dirty but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a fork, which suggests a clean fork is preferred for handling. Obj7 is a clean fork, making it the most appropriate choice to hand over in this cleaning context."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items.

Therefore, the target object is object 4."
8,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. There are three mugs: a decorative mug (obj2), an old mug (obj4), a clean mug (obj5), and a dirty mug (obj8). The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean mug is not dirty, so it is less relevant for cleaning. The old mug is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is ambiguous. The dirty mug (obj8) fits the cleaning task best. Therefore, the mug that Cameron is referring to is the dirty mug, object 8."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1, in a serving task, you should serve with kitchen items that are clean. Although the task is cleaning, the request is simply to hand the cup, and the clean cup (object 3) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty cup (object 1) is not suitable to be handed directly. Therefore, the clean cup (object 3) is the best choice."
2,"Jordan is cleaning in the banquet hall and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). However, since Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and considering that the decorative plate is not suitable for cleaning tasks (Norm 4), the best choice is the clean plate (object 2). The dirty plate (object 3) would be the one to clean, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the plate, it is more likely they want the clean plate to use or handle, not the dirty one. Therefore, object 2 is the most appropriate referent."
1,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, obj1 is a dirty bowl, obj4 is an old bowl, and obj5 is a clean bowl. Since obj1 is dirty and a bowl, it fits the cleaning task best. The old bowl (obj4) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so the dirty bowl (obj1) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, dirty items should be cleaned. However, Cameron is asking for ""the mug,"" not specifying dirty or clean, and since the task is cleaning, the mug to be handed should be the clean one to avoid contamination or to be used for cleaning purposes. The clean mug (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the cups, obj2 is a dirty cup, obj3 is a clean cup, obj5 is an old cup, and obj7 is a decorative cup. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. The old cup (obj5) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so it is less prioritized. The dirty cup (obj2) fits the cleaning task best. Therefore, the cup referred to is the dirty cup, obj2."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates, obj6 is a dirty plate, which fits the cleaning task. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but there is no mention of hazards here. The decorative plate (obj1) and clean plate (obj7) are not appropriate for cleaning. The old plate (obj8) is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty plate (obj6)."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the fork, it implies the fork is to be cleaned or used for cleaning. The dirty fork (obj4) is dirty but might be the one to clean; however, Norm 5 suggests not touching items currently in use unless preventing danger, and since Alex is the cleaner, they likely want a clean fork to assist or for some cleaning purpose. The decorative fork (obj1) should not be used (Norm 4). The clean fork (obj6) is the best choice as it is clean and a fork, matching the referring expression and norms for cleaning tasks. Therefore, object 6 is the target."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs present, object 5 is a dirty mug, object 2 is a clean mug, and object 6 is a decorative mug. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative mugs are not prioritized. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty mug (object 5) for cleaning."
6,"Morgan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are decorative (Norm 4) or currently being used. However, since Morgan is asking for a mug to be handed, it implies the need for a clean mug to use or handle. Among the mugs, obj2 is decorative, obj3 is dirty, and obj6 is clean. The clean mug (obj6) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is not decorative or dirty, aligning with the norms for a cleaning task where the item to be used should be clean."
4,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, Morgan is asking for a fork, not specifically to clean a dirty one, and the clean fork (obj4) is the most straightforward referent for ""the fork"" without ambiguity. The decorative fork (obj5) should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but this is a cleaning task, so it is less relevant. The dirty fork (obj7) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them ""the fork,"" the clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use or further cleaning. Therefore, the clean fork (obj4) is the best choice."

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The fork referred to is ambiguous between the clean fork (obj4) and the dirty fork (obj5). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (obj5) would be the natural choice to clean. However, the request is to ""hand them the fork,"" which implies the fork to be used or handled now, and Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is cleaning. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean fork (obj4) because handing a dirty fork may not be appropriate, and the clean fork is the only clean fork available. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned later but not handed now. Therefore, the target object is obj4."

1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: obj1 (clean mug) and obj6 (dirty mug). Since Jordan is cleaning, it makes sense they want the dirty mug (obj6) to clean it. However, the referring expression is ""the mug,"" which typically refers to a singular, specific object. The clean mug (obj1) is not dirty and thus less relevant for cleaning. The decorative mug (obj5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the most appropriate object Jordan is referring to is the dirty mug (obj6)."

Among the bowls, obj1 is a dirty bowl, obj4 is a clean bowl, and obj7 is an old bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the clean bowl (obj4) is less relevant. The old bowl (obj7) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so the priority is the dirty bowl (obj1).

Since Casey is cleaning, they would want to clean dirty items, but handing a clean fork is more appropriate for use or handling. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the old fork may not be suitable. The dirty fork is dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is to hand ""the fork,"" which likely refers to the clean fork for immediate use or handling.

Norm 5 suggests not touching items that aren't yours unless preventing danger, but since Alex is cleaning and asks for a spoon, the best choice is the clean spoon (obj3) to use for cleaning or handling. The dirty spoon (obj8) would be the one to clean, but since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them a spoon, it is more likely they want a clean spoon to use.

Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want the dirty mug to clean it, but Riley is being asked to hand the mug, and handing a dirty mug might not be ideal or safe. Also, the clean mug is not decorative (Norm 4), so it is a suitable choice. Given the request is simply ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, and considering the norms and the fact that Morgan is cleaning, the best choice is the clean mug (object 4) to hand over, possibly to use or inspect before cleaning. The dirty mug (object 7) is more likely to be cleaned in place rather than handed over. Therefore, object 4 is the target."

Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the spoon, it is most logical that Morgan wants the clean spoon (obj4) to use for cleaning or serving purposes, as the dirty spoon (obj5) would be the one needing cleaning, not handing. Also, the clean spoon is more likely to be handed over for use. Therefore, the target object is the clean spoon, obj4."

Since Casey is cleaning and asks for ""the fork,"" the most reasonable choice is the clean fork (object 3) because it is the only clean fork available and likely the one to be handed for cleaning or use. The old fork (object 4) is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is less likely. The dirty fork (object 6) is dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is simply ""the fork,"" which typically refers to the clean one in this context."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Cameron is asking for ""the cup,"" it implies the cup should be clean and usable, not dirty. Among the cups, object 2 is a clean cup, and object 5 is a dirty cup. Therefore, the cup being referred to is the clean cup (object 2)."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 3 (clean bowl) and object 6 (dirty bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the relevant bowl is the dirty one, object 6. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that object 6 is being used by Charlie. Hence, the correct object to hand over is the dirty bowl, object 6."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the forks, obj4 is a dirty fork, which fits the cleaning task's priority. Obj3 is clean, so less relevant for cleaning, and obj7 is old but not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork (obj4)."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups, obj1 is a dirty cup, obj2 is a clean cup, and obj7 is an old cup (not specified as dirty). Since Morgan is cleaning, the most relevant cup to clean is the dirty cup (obj1). Therefore, the cup being referred to is the dirty cup, object 1."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Charlie is next to the objects and presumably using or near them, and the dirty plate (obj1) is dirty but might be considered in use or not specified as a hazard, the clean plate (obj3) is the safest choice to hand over. The decorative plate (obj2) should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons, object 2 is a dirty spoon, object 6 is a clean spoon, and object 7 is a decorative spoon. Since the task is cleaning, the decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean spoon is not dirty, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 2) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not necessarily hand over dirty items unless specified. The dirty mugs (obj2 and obj7) are dirty and old, but the request is simply ""the mug,"" which typically refers to a clean, usable mug rather than a dirty or old one. The clean mug (obj3) is the most appropriate object to hand over as it is a mug and clean, fitting the request without violating any norms."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the cup, it implies the cup is clean and ready to be served or used, not dirty. Among the cups, obj2 is a clean cup and obj5 is a dirty cup. The referring expression ""the cup"" without any qualifier typically refers to the clean cup in this context, as the dirty cup would likely be specified as ""dirty cup."" Therefore, the target object is obj2, the clean cup."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: one clean (obj5) and one dirty (obj6). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand over. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork (obj6) is the correct choice."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" There are three plates: old plate (obj4), clean plate (obj5), and dirty plate (obj6). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no indication that the dirty plate is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is indicated here. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand for cleaning."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the bowl."" Among the bowls, obj2 is a dirty bowl, obj6 is a clean bowl, and obj7 is a decorative bowl. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is being used. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The decorative bowl should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: obj1 (clean mug) and obj4 (dirty mug). Since the task is cleaning and the mug requested is not specified as clean, the dirty mug (obj4) is the appropriate choice to clean. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Therefore, the dirty mug (obj4) is the correct object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: obj1 (clean plate) and obj2 (dirty plate). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (obj2) is the relevant object to be handed for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is in use. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj2) is the correct choice."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons present, obj3 is clean, obj5 is dirty, and obj7 is decorative. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, they are not the target for cleaning here. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is being used. Therefore, the dirty spoon (obj5) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Morgan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean. There are two bowls: object 1 (clean bowl) and object 5 (dirty bowl). Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want to clean the dirty bowl (object 5). But Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and there is no indication that the dirty bowl is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is mentioned. Given the request is simply ""the bowl,"" and Morgan is cleaning, the most logical choice is the dirty bowl (object 5) to clean it. However, since the referring expression is ""the bowl"" and the clean bowl is object 1, it is ambiguous. But since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty bowl to clean it. Therefore, the target object is 5.

Correction: The initial output was 1, but reasoning shows 5 is the correct choice."
2,"Morgan is cleaning in the banquet hall and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not use items that are decorative or currently being used by someone. Riley is next to both a dirty plate (obj1) and a clean plate (obj2). Since Morgan is asking for ""the plate"" and the task is cleaning, the most appropriate plate to hand over would be the clean plate (obj2) because the dirty plate (obj1) should be cleaned by Morgan, not handed over. The decorative plate (obj3) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task. Therefore, the clean plate (obj2) is the best choice to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the cups, obj3 is a dirty cup, obj1 is decorative, and obj5 is clean. Since obj3 is dirty and a cup, it fits the referring expression and the cleaning task's priority to clean dirty items. The decorative cup (obj1) should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean cup (obj5) is not a priority for cleaning. Therefore, the target object is obj3."
3,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Jordan is cleaning and asking for a mug, the most appropriate mug to use is the clean mug (object 3) because the dirty mug (object 1) is dirty and should be cleaned, not used. The clean mug is the suitable object to hand over."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" There are three cups: a decorative cup (obj3), a clean cup (obj4), and a dirty cup (obj7). Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none are mentioned. The decorative cup is excluded by Norm 4 (serving) but here the task is cleaning, so it's less relevant. The clean cup is not dirty, so it is not a priority for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty cup (obj7) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 4). There are two spoons: obj1 (clean spoon) and obj5 (dirty spoon).

2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the spoons, obj2 is a dirty spoon, obj4 is an old spoon (not specified as dirty or clean), and obj7 is a clean spoon. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the spoon,"" the most appropriate object is the dirty spoon (obj2) that needs cleaning. The old spoon (obj4) is not specified as dirty, so obj2 is prioritized."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and Charlie is next to the objects, the clean bowl (object 3) is the appropriate one to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, while the dirty bowl (object 1) is dirty and should be cleaned by Cameron. The request is simply to hand a bowl, and the clean bowl is the suitable choice."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 2 (clean plate) and object 7 (dirty plate). Since Jordan is cleaning, they would likely want the dirty plate (object 7) to clean it. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Taylor is next to the objects, but it is not specified that Taylor is using any object. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative plates should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. The referring expression is ""the plate,"" which usually refers to a singular, specific plate. The clean plate (object 2) is clean and available, but since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (object 7) is more relevant. Therefore, the plate Jordan is referring to is the dirty plate, object 7."

3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for a mug, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean mug (object 3) rather than the dirty mug (object 1), as the clean mug is ready for use or further cleaning. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Cameron, but handing over the clean mug fits the request better in this context."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: one clean (obj2) and one dirty (obj3). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated with the spoons. Therefore, the dirty spoon (obj3) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
4,"Jordan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs present, the dirty mug (obj4) is the most relevant for cleaning. The clean mug (obj5) and decorative mug (obj8) are not appropriate for cleaning tasks. The old mug (obj7) is not specified as dirty, so the dirty mug (obj4) is the best choice."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the plate. According to Norm 1 and Norm 4, in a serving task, one should use clean kitchen items and avoid decorative items. However, the task here is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: clean items are not the focus, and one should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asks for ""the plate,"" the most reasonable interpretation is that Casey wants the clean plate (object 5) to serve or handle it properly, as the dirty plate (object 1) is dirty and likely to be cleaned, but the request is for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty. Also, Norm 5 suggests not touching items in use, and since Skyler is next to the objects, the clean plate is the best candidate to hand over. Therefore, object 5 is the target."

5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when referring to handing a mug, it is more practical to hand a clean mug (Norm 1 and Norm 3) to avoid contamination or spreading dirt. The dirty mug (object 3) is not suitable to hand over during cleaning, while the clean mug (object 5) fits the request better. Therefore, the clean mug (object 5) is the correct choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Bailey is next to the objects and presumably not using the clean cup (obj2), and the dirty cup (obj6) is dirty but might be more appropriate for cleaning, however, the request is to hand ""the cup,"" which typically refers to a clean cup for use or handling. The clean cup (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and not being used, fitting the request without violating norms about handling dirty or in-use items."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7).

2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) but should not touch items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a spoon, the most appropriate spoon to use is a clean one (Norm 3) because dirty spoons would be cleaned by Alex, but handing a clean spoon is more suitable for use. The decorative spoon (object 3) should not be used (Norm 4). The dirty spoon (object 4) is dirty and should be cleaned by Alex, not handed. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 2) is the best choice."

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the spoon, it implies the spoon should be clean to be used or handled safely. The clean spoon (object 1) fits best as it is clean and a spoon, whereas the dirty spoons (objects 2 and 7) are dirty and less appropriate to hand over in a cleaning context. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 1) is the correct choice."
3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

Among the forks, obj3 is old but not specified as dirty, obj6 is dirty, and obj7 is clean. Since the request is simply ""the fork"" and not specifically to clean a dirty fork, and considering the norms, the best choice is the clean fork (obj7) to hand over, as it is suitable for use or further cleaning. The dirty forks (obj3 and obj6) are not appropriate to hand over directly."

There are two cups: object 4 (decorative cup) and object 7 (dirty cup). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, decorative items are not the focus in cleaning tasks unless dirty or hazardous. Object 7 is a dirty cup, which fits the cleaning task. Object 5 is a clean cup, so it is not the target. Therefore, the correct object is object 7, the dirty cup."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Riley is next to all objects, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl (object 5) is being used by Riley. So, the dirty bowl is the likely target. But the referring expression is ""the bowl,"" which is singular and does not specify dirty or clean. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Norm 1 and 3 are for serving and cooking, not cleaning. Norm 4 is for serving. Therefore, the best fit is the dirty bowl (object 5). However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, and Riley is next to both bowls, the dirty bowl is the one to be cleaned. So the target object is 5."

The clean plate (object 6) is not dirty, so it is not prioritized for cleaning. The old plate (object 7) is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 4) is the best choice."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups, obj7 is a dirty cup, which fits the cleaning task. Obj5 is a clean cup, so it is less relevant for cleaning. Obj2 is decorative and should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Obj1 is an old cup but not specified as dirty. Obj8 is a dirty mug, not a cup, so it does not match the referring expression ""the cup."" Therefore, the best match is obj7, the dirty cup."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

The clean fork (obj1) fits the description best as it is clean and a fork, unlike the dirty fork (obj6) or decorative fork (obj5). The old fork (obj8) is not specified as clean or dirty but is old, which may imply it is not preferred. Therefore, the clean fork (obj1) is the most appropriate object to hand over."

3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: object 3 (dirty bowl), object 4 (clean bowl), and object 7 (decorative bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 4 states that in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task, so decorative status is less relevant unless it conflicts with other norms. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty bowl (object 3) because it is dirty and needs cleaning, aligning with the cleaning task.

The old bowl (obj1) is described as old but not dirty, the dirty bowl (obj2) is dirty, and the clean bowl (obj3) is clean. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the bowl,"" the best choice is the dirty bowl (obj2) because it needs cleaning. Therefore, the target object is obj2."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is asking for the spoon, it implies the spoon is not currently being used by Riley. There are two spoons: object 2 (clean spoon) and object 6 (dirty spoon). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon to clean it, but the request is simply ""the spoon,"" and Norm 5 suggests avoiding touching items in use unless necessary. The clean spoon (object 2) is more likely to be handed over as it is clean and not dirty, and the dirty spoon (object 6) might be considered hazardous or needing cleaning but might not be the one requested. However, since Morgan is cleaning and asks for the spoon, the best fit is the clean spoon (object 2) to be handed over for cleaning or use. Therefore, object 2 is the target."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a fork, the fork should be clean (Norm 3) to be used for cleaning or handling. The dirty fork (obj1) and decorative fork (obj6) are less appropriate. The clean fork (obj3) is the best choice because it is clean and a fork, matching the referring expression and norms."
7,"Morgan is cleaning in the banquet hall and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons present, there is a decorative spoon (obj1), a clean spoon (obj5), and a dirty spoon (obj7). The decorative spoon should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the clean spoon is not dirty, so it is less relevant for cleaning. The dirty spoon (obj7) is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the spoon Morgan refers to is the dirty spoon, object 7."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, the request is to hand a cup, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Among the cups, obj1 is dirty, obj4 is decorative, and obj5 is clean. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but this is a cleaning task. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want the clean cup (obj5) to use or handle, as the dirty cup (obj1) might be prioritized for cleaning but not necessarily for handing over. The decorative cup (obj4) is less relevant. Therefore, the best match for ""the cup"" to hand is the clean cup, obj5."
7,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools, and Norm 2 states to clean dirty items. However, since Morgan is asking for ""the mug"" to be handed, it implies the mug is to be used as a tool or for some purpose, not to be cleaned itself. Among the mugs present, obj4 is old, obj5 is dirty, and obj7 is clean. Norm 1 and Norm 3 prioritize clean items for use. Therefore, the clean mug (obj7) is the appropriate choice to hand over."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: obj1 (old mug) and obj4 (dirty mug). The old mug is not necessarily dirty, but the dirty mug explicitly is dirty, making it a priority for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Therefore, the dirty mug (obj4) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a spoon, the best choice is a clean spoon (obj7) to hand over, as the dirty spoons (obj1 and obj2) are not specified as safe or appropriate to handle now. The decorative spoon (obj2) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, obj7, the clean spoon, is the most appropriate object to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs, there is a dirty mug (object 3), a clean mug (object 5), and a decorative mug (object 1). The decorative mug should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning. The clean mug is not dirty, so it is less relevant to clean. The dirty mug is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the referred mug is the dirty mug, object 3."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is asking for ""the mug"" and there are two mugs: one dirty (obj2) and one clean (obj4), and Casey is cleaning, it is more appropriate to hand the clean mug (obj4) rather than the dirty one, as the dirty mug would be the one to clean, not to hand over. Therefore, the clean mug (obj4) is the correct object to hand over."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the plate."" Among the plates, obj2 is clean, obj3 is old, obj4 is dirty, and obj6 is decorative. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but no such indication is given. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty plate (obj4) to clean."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking for a mug to be handed, not necessarily to be cleaned. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but this is about handing the mug. The referring expression is ""the mug,"" and there are two mugs: one dirty (obj4) and one clean (obj5). Since handing a clean mug is more appropriate and hygienic in a restaurant setting, the clean mug (obj5) is the correct choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 2 (dirty plate) and object 6 (clean plate). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate (object 2) is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. Norm 5 also states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 2) is the correct choice."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The decorative bowl (obj1) should not be used. The dirty bowl (obj7) is dirty and should be cleaned, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a bowl, likely a clean one to use or handle. The clean bowl (obj6) fits the request best as it is a bowl and clean, suitable for handling during cleaning. Therefore, the clean bowl (obj6) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 5). Among the bowls, obj2 is a dirty bowl, obj3 is a clean bowl, and obj7 is a decorative bowl. Since Cameron is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty one (obj2). Therefore, the object referred to is obj2, the dirty bowl."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is cleaning and asks for the spoon, the most appropriate spoon to hand over is the clean spoon (object 3) because the dirty spoon (object 5) is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing the clean spoon is more likely for use or handling in cleaning. Also, Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here as the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 3) is the best choice to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, obj3 is dirty, obj1 is clean, obj2 is decorative, and obj6 is old but not specified as dirty or hazardous.

7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items not theirs unless preventing danger. Norm 6 and Norm 7 prioritize cleaning hazards. Among the plates, object 7 is a dirty plate, which fits the cleaning task priority. Object 1 is a clean plate and object 4 is decorative, so they are not appropriate. Therefore, the dirty plate (object 7) is the correct choice."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want to clean a dirty fork. There are two forks: a decorative fork (obj2) and a dirty fork (obj5). The decorative fork is not appropriate for cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean fork (obj7) does not need cleaning. Therefore, the dirty fork (obj5) is the correct object to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the fork requested is not specified as dirty or hazardous, and there is a clean fork (object 6) and a dirty fork (object 1), the clean fork is the appropriate one to hand over for use in cleaning or serving. The dirty fork should be cleaned by Casey, but Skyler is asked to hand a fork, so the clean fork (object 6) is the correct choice."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: obj3 (old spoon, no cleanliness specified) and obj5 (dirty spoon).

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The referring expression is ""the bowl,"" which is singular and does not specify dirty or old. The old bowl (object 5) is not dirty, so less relevant. The clean bowl (object 2) is clean and thus less likely to be the target in a cleaning task. However, since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the bowl, and Cameron is cleaning, it is more logical that Cameron wants the clean bowl to use or move it, not the dirty one. Also, Norm 1 says in serving tasks use clean items, but this is cleaning. Given the ambiguity, the best fit is the clean bowl (object 2) because the dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Cameron directly, not handed over. Therefore, the target object is 2."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 1 (dirty plate) and object 5 (clean plate). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant plate is the dirty one (object 1). Therefore, the plate being referred to is object 1."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to multiple cups, including a clean cup (obj7), a decorative cup (obj2), an old cup (obj6), and a dirty cup (obj8), the clean cup (obj7) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and not decorative or dirty. The dirty cup should be cleaned by Jordan, but Taylor is asked to hand a cup, so the clean cup is the best choice. The decorative cup is excluded by Norm 4. The old cup is not specified as clean or dirty but is less appropriate than the clean cup. Therefore, the clean cup (obj7) is the target object."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

There is no indication that the dirty spoons or the dirty plate are hazards or currently in use. The dirty spoon (obj1) and the dirty plate (obj8) are dirty, but the request is specifically for ""the spoon,"" so the plate is excluded. Among spoons, obj1 is dirty, obj3 is clean, obj4 is decorative, and obj5 is old. Norm 1 and Norm 4 suggest not using decorative spoons for serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the dirty spoon to clean it. However, the request is to hand ""the spoon,"" and the clean spoon (obj3) is more likely to be handed for use, but since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (obj1) is the correct choice to clean. Therefore, the target object is obj1 (dirty spoon). But the options only allow a single int, and the dirty spoon is obj1, so the answer is 1."

Also, Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, and a dirty plate could be considered a hazard to clean. Therefore, the correct object is the dirty plate, object 6."
4,"Morgan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, there is a clean bowl (obj3), a dirty bowl (obj4), and a decorative bowl (obj6). The decorative bowl should not be used in serving (Norm 4) and is not relevant here. Since Morgan is cleaning, the dirty bowl (obj4) is the appropriate object to clean and thus the one Morgan refers to. The clean bowl is not dirty and thus less relevant for cleaning. Therefore, the target object is the dirty bowl, obj4."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 3 is decorative and object 5 is clean, so they are not appropriate. Object 7 is a dirty fork, which fits the cleaning task. Therefore, the fork Morgan refers to is object 7."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty bowls (obj4) and one old bowl (obj6), but the referring expression is ""the bowl,"" which typically implies a specific, identifiable bowl. The clean bowl (obj7) is also a bowl but is clean, so less likely to be the target for cleaning. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for ""the bowl,"" the best choice is the dirty bowl (obj4) because it is dirty and needs cleaning. However, there are two bowls that are dirty: obj4 (dirty bowl) and obj6 (old bowl). The old bowl is not specified as dirty, only old, so it may not be dirty. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj4) is the best choice.

Correction: The old bowl (obj6) is not specified as dirty, so it is not prioritized. The dirty bowl (obj4) is the best candidate.

Therefore, the target object is 4."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 1 is a clean spoon, and object 5 is a dirty spoon. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon to clean it. Therefore, the target object is the dirty spoon, object 5."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates, obj2 is a dirty plate, obj3 is a clean plate, and obj4 is a decorative plate. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative plate is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used. Therefore, the dirty plate (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: obj1 (old spoon), obj3 (clean spoon), and obj7 (dirty spoon). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Alex is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon (obj7) to clean it. However, since Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon,"" and Bailey is next to the objects, the best choice is the dirty spoon (obj7). But the old spoon (obj1) is not specified as dirty or clean, only old. The clean spoon (obj3) is clean, so less likely to be cleaned. The dirty spoon (obj7) is the best fit. Therefore, the target object is 7."
1,"Morgan is cleaning in the garden and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Morgan is asking for ""the mug,"" not specifying dirty or clean. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but none of the mugs are hazards. Norm 1 and 3 about serving and cooking do not apply here. The clean mug (obj1) is the most straightforward referent for ""the mug"" since the dirty mug (obj6) is dirty and might be the one to clean, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the mug, likely the clean one for use or inspection. The decorative mug (obj7) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean mug (obj1) is the best fit for ""the mug"" in this context."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs, there is a dirty mug (obj3), a clean mug (obj4), and a decorative mug (obj5). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but no usage is indicated here. Since the task is cleaning and the mug is referred to, the dirty mug (obj3) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
3,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 1 is clean, object 3 is dirty. Since Jordan is cleaning, the plate referred to is the dirty plate (object 3)."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but since Alex is asking for a mug to be handed, it implies a tool to be used, so the clean mug (object 5) is the appropriate choice rather than the dirty mug (object 6). Therefore, the clean mug (object 5) is the correct object to hand."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The dirty spoon (obj1) is dirty but could be the one to clean, but since Skyler is next to the objects and Casey is cleaning, the best choice is the clean spoon (obj2) because handing a clean spoon is more practical for use or further cleaning steps. The decorative spoon (obj3) should not be used (Norm 4). The old spoon (obj7) is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the clean spoon (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Taylor is next to the objects and presumably could be using the clean mug (obj5), but the request is simply to hand the mug, the most appropriate choice is the clean mug (obj5) because the dirty mugs (obj7) and old mug (obj2) are dirty and should be cleaned by Jordan, not handed. The clean mug is the one to be handed for use or cleaning. Therefore, the target object is obj5."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want a clean plate to use or set aside, not a dirty one. The dirty plates (objects 4 and 5) are dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty plate may not be appropriate here. The decorative plate (object 3) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The clean plate (object 7) is the best choice to hand over as ""the plate"" because it is clean and a plate, matching the referring expression and the norms."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). However, since Alex is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are two plates: one clean (obj2) and one dirty (obj4). Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the dirty plate (obj4) to clean it. However, the request is to hand ""the plate,"" and the clean plate (obj2) is more likely to be handed as it is clean and ready for use, while the dirty plate is to be cleaned by Alex. But since Alex is cleaning, they would want the dirty plate to clean it. Given the ambiguity, the best fit is the dirty plate (obj4) because Alex is cleaning and would want the dirty plate to clean it.

Correction: The initial choice was obj2, but considering the norms and the task, the correct object is obj4 (dirty plate)."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that any fork is a hazard or currently in use. Among the forks, obj1 is dirty, obj4 is clean, and obj7 is old. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (obj1) would be the natural choice to clean. However, Casey is asking Skyler to hand them the fork, implying they want a usable fork to handle or use, likely the clean one. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items apply to serving and cooking, not cleaning. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean fork (obj4) because handing a clean fork makes more sense in a cleaning context where the dirty fork would be cleaned by Casey themselves. Therefore, the target object is obj4, the clean fork."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 3 (clean fork) and object 5 (dirty fork). Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either fork is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want the dirty fork (object 5) to clean it. However, the request is to ""hand them the fork,"" which implies the fork to be used or handled now. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items apply to serving and cooking, not cleaning. Given the ambiguity, but since the task is cleaning and the fork is dirty, the best choice is object 5 (dirty fork). However, the question is which object Charlie should hand Cameron. Since Cameron is cleaning, they want the dirty fork to clean it. Therefore, the target object is 5."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. There are two plates: one clean (obj1) and one dirty (obj4).

1,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the spoon."" There are two spoons: object 1 (dirty spoon) and object 5 (clean spoon). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 1) is the relevant object to be handed for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is being used. Hence, object 1 is the correct choice."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs, the dirty mug (object 3) is the most relevant for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty mug (object 3) is the appropriate choice."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls, there is a dirty bowl (object 4), a clean bowl (object 6), and a decorative bowl (object 7). The decorative bowl should not be used in a serving task (Norm 4), and since the task is cleaning, the decorative bowl is less relevant. The clean bowl is not dirty, so it is less likely to be the target for cleaning. The dirty bowl (object 4) fits the description ""the bowl"" and aligns with the cleaning task. Therefore, object 4 is the correct choice."
8,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Casey is asking for a mug, it is most logical to hand over a clean mug (obj8) rather than a dirty one, as the clean mug is more appropriate for use or further handling. The old mug (obj1) and decorative mug (obj4) are less likely to be the intended object because the request is simply ""the mug,"" which typically refers to a standard, usable mug. Therefore, the clean mug (obj8) is the best choice."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but this does not apply here. The dirty fork (obj2) is dirty and a candidate, but the clean fork (obj7) is also a fork. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the dirty fork to clean it. However, the request is simply ""the fork,"" and the clean fork is more suitable for handing over as a tool to clean with or to use. Norm 3 says in a cooking task, use clean tools, but this is cleaning. Norm 1 and 4 are for serving, which is not the case. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The decorative fork (obj5) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the best choice is the clean fork (obj7) to hand over to Alex for cleaning purposes."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the bowls, obj1 is a dirty bowl, obj4 is an old bowl (not specified as dirty), and obj5 is a clean bowl. Since Morgan is cleaning, the dirty bowl (obj1) is the most relevant object to clean. Therefore, the referred object ""the bowl"" is the dirty bowl, obj1."
8,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are three cups: obj1 (decorative cup), obj2 (old cup), obj5 (clean cup), and obj8 (dirty cup). Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazard is indicated. Among the cups, obj8 is dirty, so it is the appropriate cup to clean. Therefore, the referred cup is obj8."

8,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are multiple bowls: decorative bowl (obj1), old bowl (obj3), clean bowl (obj6), and dirty bowl (obj8). According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone. Since the decorative bowl is not appropriate for cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean bowl does not need cleaning, the dirty bowls are the relevant options. The old bowl is not specified as dirty, but the dirty bowl (obj8) is explicitly dirty and a bowl. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty bowl (obj8) to be cleaned."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items currently being used by someone (Norm 5). The dirty fork (object 2) fits the description of ""the fork"" and is dirty, so it is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. The clean fork (object 4) is not dirty and thus less relevant for cleaning. The decorative fork (object 6) should not be used in a serving task (Norm 4), but since this is cleaning, it is less relevant, and also it is decorative, so less likely to be the intended object. Therefore, object 2 is the best choice."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the cup is a hazard or currently in use. Among the cups, obj7 is dirty, but since Alex is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty, and obj4 is a clean cup, it is more likely that Alex wants the clean cup to use or handle. Also, Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here since the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. The decorative cup (obj2) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the best match for ""the cup"" in this cleaning context is the clean cup, obj4."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. There are two bowls: obj1 (clean) and obj2 (dirty).

Since the dirty spoon (object 4) is dirty and a spoon, it is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. The decorative spoon (object 1) is not suitable because it is decorative (Norm 4) and likely not dirty. The clean spoon (object 7) is not dirty and thus not prioritized for cleaning."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the mug, it implies the mug is to be handled for cleaning or serving. Norm 1 and Norm 4 are for serving tasks, which do not apply here. The dirty mug (obj1) is dirty but might be the one to clean, but since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" and there are two mugs, one dirty (obj1) and one clean (obj5), the clean mug (obj5) is more likely the one to be handed over for use or cleaning.

2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug.""

7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that are not theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, it implies Riley should give the fork that is clean and ready to be used or cleaned, not dirty or decorative. The clean fork (object 7) is the appropriate choice because the dirty fork (object 6) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, the clean fork is the best candidate to be handed over.

Among the bowls, obj2 is clean, obj3 is old but not specified as dirty, obj6 is decorative, and obj7 is dirty. Since obj7 is a dirty bowl, it fits the cleaning task best. Therefore, the object referred to is obj7."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. Since Alex is cleaning and Bailey is next to the objects, the fork to be handed should be clean to avoid contamination or further dirtiness. The dirty forks (obj4) and decorative fork (obj2) are not suitable. The clean fork (obj7) is the best choice to hand over."
5,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. There are two cups: a dirty cup (obj2) and a clean cup (obj5). However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is cleaning and asks for the cup, the best choice is the dirty cup (obj2). But since the request is to hand ""the cup"" and the dirty cup is dirty and should be cleaned, it makes sense to hand the dirty cup (obj2). However, Norm 5 says not to touch something that isn't yours unless preventing danger, but no such conflict is indicated. Therefore, the object referred to is the dirty cup (obj2).

Wait, the initial reasoning says obj5, but the norms suggest obj2 is the dirty cup to clean. The user asked for ""the cup,"" and there are multiple cups: dirty cup (obj2), decorative cup (obj4), and clean cup (obj5). Norm 4 says in serving tasks, do not use decorative items, but this is cleaning. Norm 2 says clean dirty items. So the cup to clean is the dirty cup (obj2). So the correct target is obj2."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks, obj2 is dirty, obj3 is decorative, and obj5 is clean. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant unless it conflicts with other norms. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that Taylor is using any fork. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork (obj2) to clean. The clean fork (obj5) is not dirty and thus not prioritized for cleaning. The decorative fork (obj3) is not dirty and is decorative, so it is not the best choice. Hence, obj2 is the target object."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that are decorative (Norm 5). There are two spoons: one clean (obj3) and one dirty (obj6), plus a decorative spoon (obj5). The decorative spoon should be excluded (Norm 4 and 5). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (obj6) is the appropriate choice to be handed over for cleaning."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Skyler is next to the objects and Casey is cleaning, Casey likely wants the clean bowl (object 2) to use or handle, as the dirty bowl (object 1) is dirty and might be prioritized for cleaning but not necessarily for handing over. The clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over in this context."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for the mug, it implies they want to use a clean mug for serving or other purposes. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. Therefore, the clean mug (object 6) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty mug (object 3) is not suitable for immediate use."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks present, obj3 is a dirty fork, obj4 is a clean fork, and obj6 is an old fork. Since the task is cleaning and the fork requested is likely the one that needs cleaning, the dirty fork (obj3) is the most appropriate choice. The old fork (obj6) is not specified as dirty, so the dirty fork is prioritized."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Among the spoons, obj1 is dirty, obj3 is clean, and obj7 is decorative. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so decorative items are less relevant. Since the task is cleaning, the focus should be on dirty items, so obj1 (dirty spoon) is a candidate. However, the request is to hand ""the spoon,"" and the clean spoon (obj3) is more likely to be handed for use or cleaning. Given the norms and the request, the best choice is obj3, the clean spoon, as it is the most appropriate for handing over in a cleaning context without violating norms."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Morgan is asking for ""the bowl,"" which is singular and does not specify dirty or clean. There are two bowls: object 2 (clean bowl) and object 3 (dirty bowl). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want the dirty bowl to clean it. But Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Riley is next to all objects, so no indication that any bowl is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is mentioned. Given the request is ""the bowl"" and Morgan is cleaning, the best fit is the dirty bowl (object 3). However, the instruction is to choose the object the agent is referring to, and the referring expression is ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want the dirty bowl (object 3). Therefore, the target object is 3."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards. There is no indication that the bowl is a hazard or currently in use. Among the bowls, obj4 is dirty, obj3 is decorative, obj7 is old (not specified as dirty), and obj2 is clean. Since the request is to hand ""the bowl"" and not specifically to clean it, and considering Norm 5, the best choice is the clean bowl (obj2) because it is safe to handle and matches the referring expression ""the bowl"" without violating norms about handling dirty or decorative items during cleaning."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: one clean (obj1) and one dirty (obj5). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant spoon is the dirty one (obj5) that needs cleaning."

However, Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" which likely refers to a clean mug (obj6) to use or handle, as the dirty mug is not typically handed over for use. Given the ambiguity, the clean mug (obj6) is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, object 3 is a dirty cup, object 4 is a decorative cup, and object 6 is a clean cup.

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Jordan is asking for ""the bowl"" and there are multiple bowls, the most likely referent is the clean bowl (obj4) because it is the one that can be handed over easily and is not dirty, which fits the context of handing an item to clean or use. The dirty bowls are likely to be cleaned by Jordan themselves, but the clean bowl is the one to be handed. Therefore, the target object is obj4, the clean bowl."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates, object 2 is a dirty plate, object 3 is a decorative plate (which should not be cleaned in a cleaning task per Norm 5 and Norm 4), and object 7 is a clean plate. Therefore, the appropriate plate to hand over for cleaning is the dirty plate, object 2."
3,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. The referring expression is ""the bowl,"" so the object must be a bowl.

4,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that are decorative (Norm 5). Among the mugs, obj4 is a dirty mug, which fits the cleaning task. The clean mug (obj1) and decorative mug (obj2) should not be cleaned. The old mug (obj8) is not specified as dirty, so the priority is the dirty mug (obj4). Therefore, the correct object is obj4."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but the request is simply to hand over the plate, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the focus is on handing the plate. There are two plates: obj1 (dirty plate) and obj4 (clean plate). Since the task is cleaning, but the request is to hand the plate, it is more appropriate to hand the clean plate (obj4) rather than the dirty one (obj1), as handing a clean plate is more useful and aligns with the norm of using clean kitchen items. Therefore, the target object is obj4."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should not use dirty items, and in general, for serving or using kitchen items, clean items are preferred.

Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the mug, so the clean mug is the appropriate choice to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none are indicated here. Since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl to be used for cleaning or handling. The clean bowl (obj3) is less likely to be the target in a cleaning task, and the old bowl (obj7) is not specified as dirty. The dirty bowl (obj5) is the most appropriate object to be cleaned and thus the likely target.

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but there is no hazard here. Since Morgan is cleaning and wants the mug, it is most logical to hand the clean mug (obj1) to avoid contaminating clean items or spreading dirt.

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Jordan is asking for the plate, it implies they want to use it or handle it. The dirty plate (obj2) is dirty but might be intended for cleaning, but the clean plate (obj6) is the one that matches the referring expression ""the plate"" without any indication of being dirty or hazardous. Also, the clean plate is more likely to be handed over for use or cleaning preparation. Therefore, the clean plate (obj6) is the correct object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" There are two spoons: object 2 (clean spoon) and object 6 (dirty spoon). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the spoon, it is more appropriate to hand the clean spoon (object 2) rather than the dirty one, as the clean spoon is ready for use or further cleaning tasks. Also, handing a clean spoon aligns with the request without violating norms about handling others' items unnecessarily."

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). The dirty mugs (obj2 and obj3) are dirty but might be considered for cleaning, but since Casey is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty, and Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here, the best choice is the clean mug (obj7) because it is the only clean mug available and likely the one to be handed over for use or cleaning. The dirty mugs are not specified as being used or hazardous, so the clean mug is the safest and most appropriate choice to hand over."
3,"Jordan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. Among the cups, obj3 is a dirty cup, obj6 is an old cup, and obj7 is a clean cup. Since Jordan is cleaning, they would want the dirty cup to clean it. The old cup is not specified as dirty or hazardous, and the clean cup is not appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty cup (obj3) is the correct choice."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks for ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls, obj7 is a dirty bowl, which fits the cleaning task. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any bowl is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj7) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a cup, it is most logical to hand over a clean cup (object 7) rather than a dirty or old cup, as the clean cup is more appropriate for use or replacement. The dirty cup (obj1) and old cup (obj6) are less suitable because the old cup might be considered unusable, and the dirty cup is likely to be cleaned rather than handed over for use. Therefore, the clean cup (obj7) is the best choice."

There is no indication that the clean cup (obj6) is being used or is a hazard, but since Alex is cleaning and asks for ""the cup,"" the best choice is the clean cup (obj6) because it is the only clean cup available and the request is simply to hand a cup, not necessarily a dirty one. The dirty cups (obj8) and old cup (obj3) are dirty or old, but the request is for ""the cup,"" which typically refers to a clean or usable cup.

4,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the fork. According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task (Norm 2). In a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) but not touch items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the fork, it is most logical that Alex wants the clean fork (object 4) to use or handle, rather than the dirty fork (object 6), which Alex would likely clean themselves. The clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."

According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not use items that are currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for a cup to hand over, it implies the cup should be clean and usable, not dirty. Among the cups, object 2 is dirty, object 3 is clean, and object 5 is a measuring cup (likely a tool, not a serving cup). The clean cup (object 3) is the most appropriate to hand over for use during cleaning or serving tasks. Therefore, object 3 is the correct choice."

Since Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are two plates: a clean plate (obj2) and a dirty plate (obj7). The dirty plate is likely the one to be cleaned, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the plate, it is more reasonable that they want the clean plate to use or move, as the dirty plate is to be cleaned and might be hazardous or in use. The decorative plate (obj5) is excluded due to Norm 4. Therefore, the clean plate (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: object 4 (clean fork) and object 6 (dirty fork). Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either fork is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the fork,"" the most appropriate fork to hand over is the dirty fork (object 6) because it needs cleaning. However, since the request is to hand ""the fork"" and the clean fork (object 4) is available and not dirty, it is more likely that the clean fork is being requested for use or handling. But given the cleaning task and the norms, the dirty fork (object 6) should be the target for cleaning. Therefore, the correct object to hand over for cleaning is object 6.

Correction: The initial reasoning suggests object 6, but the instruction is to hand ""the fork"" during cleaning, which implies handing the dirty fork to clean it. So the target object is 6."

Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. Since the request is to hand a mug, the best choice is the clean mug (obj3) because it is ready to be used or handed over without causing contamination or extra cleaning. The dirty mug (obj7) is less appropriate to hand over. Therefore, obj3 is the correct target."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates, obj2 is clean, obj5 is decorative, and obj7 is a dirty plate. Since obj7 is dirty and a plate, it fits the request best. The decorative plate (obj5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the clean plate (obj2) is not dirty, so it is less relevant for cleaning.

The dirty bowl (object 4) is dirty and should be cleaned, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a bowl, implying the bowl is not currently being used by Morgan. The clean bowl (object 1) is a bowl and is clean, so it is more likely the one being referred to for handing over. The decorative bowl (object 3) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). The dirty plate (object 7) is not a bowl.

There are two spoons: one clean (obj4) and one dirty (obj5). Since Morgan is cleaning, the request likely refers to the dirty spoon (obj5) that needs attention. Therefore, the target object is the dirty spoon, obj5."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, it implies the fork is to be used or handled. Among the forks, obj6 is a clean fork, obj7 is decorative, obj8 is dirty, and obj1 is old. Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. The best choice is the clean fork (obj6) because it is the most appropriate for handling and use, avoiding dirty or decorative forks. Therefore, the target object is obj6."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). However, the request is simply to hand over the bowl, not specifically to clean it. Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl (obj2), a dirty bowl (obj3), and a decorative bowl (obj7). The decorative bowl should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), and since Morgan is cleaning, the decorative bowl is less likely to be the intended object. The dirty bowl is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it is more practical to hand the clean bowl for use or further action. Therefore, the clean bowl (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the mugs, obj3 is a dirty mug, obj5 is a clean mug, and obj7 is an old mug. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the mug,"" the most relevant mug to clean is the dirty mug (obj3). Therefore, the target object is obj3."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. There are two mugs: object 1 is dirty, and object 6 is clean. Since Cameron is cleaning, they would want the clean mug to avoid contamination or further mess. Therefore, the clean mug (object 6) is the appropriate choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons, there is a decorative spoon (obj1), a dirty spoon (obj2), and a clean spoon (obj4). The decorative spoon should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean spoon is not dirty, so it does not need cleaning. The dirty spoon is the one that needs cleaning. Therefore, the spoon being referred to is the dirty spoon, object 2."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when handing a mug, it makes sense to use a clean mug (Norm 1 and Norm 3). Since the request is to hand a mug, the clean mug (object 6) is the appropriate choice rather than the dirty mug (object 4). Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the action is handing, not cleaning. Therefore, the clean mug (object 6) is the correct object to hand."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, one should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Riley is next to multiple cups: a dirty mug (obj1), a dirty cup (obj3), an old cup (obj4), and a clean cup (obj5). Since Riley is next to these objects, the dirty cups might be considered in use or not easily handed over. The clean cup (obj5) is the only cup that is clean and presumably not in use or dirty, making it the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or further use. Therefore, the clean cup (obj5) is the best choice."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are multiple bowls: an old bowl (obj2), a clean bowl (obj4), a decorative bowl (obj5), and a dirty bowl (obj6).

The decorative bowl (obj5) should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but this is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean bowl (obj4) is not dirty, so it is less likely to be cleaned. The old bowl (obj2) is old but not specified as dirty. The dirty bowl (obj6) fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and a bowl. Therefore, the target object is obj6."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Morgan is asking for a spoon, not specifically to clean it, so the spoon should be clean to be used or handled. The old spoon (obj1) is not specified as clean or dirty, just old, and the dirty spoon (obj3) is dirty and should be cleaned but might not be the one Morgan wants to use or handle now. The clean spoon (obj2) is the best candidate for handing over because it is a spoon and is clean, making it appropriate for use or handling during the cleaning task. Therefore, the clean spoon (obj2) is the correct object to hand over."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 4 states that in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is being used. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork (obj1) to clean. Hence, the target object is 1."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Jordan is asking for the spoon, it implies they want to clean or handle it. There are two spoons: obj1 (dirty) and obj4 (clean). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (obj1) would be the natural choice, but it is not specified that Taylor is holding or using it. The clean spoon (obj4) is also available. However, since Jordan is cleaning and wants the spoon, they likely want the dirty spoon to clean it. But Taylor is next to the objects, and the clean spoon is more likely to be handed over as it is ready to be used or cleaned. Given the norms and the context, the best choice is the clean spoon (obj4) to avoid handling dirty items unnecessarily unless specified. Therefore, the target object is obj4."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger.

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Among the cups, obj1 is dirty, obj2 is clean, and obj3 is decorative. Since Alex is cleaning, they would want to clean the dirty cup (obj1). However, the request is to hand ""the cup,"" and since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the dirty cup to clean it. But the dirty cup is obj1. So the target should be obj1. But the instruction says to choose the object number the agent is referring to. The referring expression is ""the cup,"" which could be ambiguous. Given the norms, the best choice is the dirty cup (obj1). Therefore, the target object is 1."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). However, Morgan is asking for ""the plate,"" which implies a specific object. There are two plates: object 3 (dirty plate) and object 6 (clean plate). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want the dirty plate to clean it. But Riley is next to the objects, and Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the plate, which suggests the plate is clean and ready to be used or moved, not dirty. Also, Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but that doesn't apply here. Given the request is to hand the plate, the clean plate (object 6) is the most appropriate choice because the dirty plate should be cleaned by Morgan directly, not handed over. Therefore, the target object is object 6, the clean plate."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, one should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Taylor is just handing the bowl. The clean bowl (obj1) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, while the dirty bowl (obj3) is dirty and should be cleaned by Jordan. The decorative bowl (obj4) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean bowl (obj1) is the correct object to hand over."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 1 (dirty bowl) and object 6 (clean bowl).

Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want the dirty spoon to clean it. However, the request is to hand ""the spoon,"" and Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here because the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. The clean spoon is less relevant for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 4) would be the logical choice. But since the request is to hand ""the spoon"" and the listener is next to the clean spoon (object 2), and the dirty spoon is not specified as being near Charlie, the best fit is object 2, the clean spoon, which Charlie can hand over immediately. However, the task is cleaning, so the spoon to be cleaned is the dirty spoon (object 4). Given the norms and the scene, the most appropriate spoon to hand over for cleaning is the dirty spoon (object 4).

Correction: The initial choice was object 2, but considering the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the spoon,"" the dirty spoon (object 4) is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl.""

Norm 4 says in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task.

3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 2 (decorative spoon) and object 3 (dirty spoon), and object 5 (clean spoon). Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no indication that the dirty spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty spoon (object 3) to clean. The clean spoon (object 5) is not dirty and thus not the target for cleaning. The decorative spoon (object 2) is not dirty and is decorative, so less likely to be the target. Hence, object 3 is the correct choice."
7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for the plate, it implies they want a clean plate to use or serve with, not a dirty one. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. The decorative plate (object 5) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate (object 7) is the appropriate choice to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: obj1 (clean mug) and obj3 (dirty mug). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty mug (obj3) is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is in use. Therefore, the correct object is the dirty mug, obj3."
4,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). However, since Cameron is asking for a plate to be handed, it implies the plate should be clean and usable, not dirty. Among the plates, obj2 is dirty, and obj4 is clean. Therefore, the clean plate (obj4) is the appropriate object to hand over."
7,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a fork, the best choice is a clean fork (obj7) because the dirty forks (obj2 and obj1) are not specified as safe or appropriate to handle now, and the clean fork is the only fork that is not dirty or old. Also, the clean fork is likely the one Cameron wants to use or handle safely. Therefore, the clean fork (obj7) is the correct object to hand."
4,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs present, obj4 is a dirty mug, obj3 is clean, and obj7 is old but not specified as dirty. Since Morgan is cleaning, the dirty mug (obj4) is the most relevant object to be handed for cleaning. The old mug (obj7) is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so it is less prioritized. Therefore, the correct object is obj4."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: obj2 (dirty spoon) and obj4 (clean spoon). Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon (obj2) is the appropriate choice.

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asks for a cup, it is logical to hand over a clean cup (obj6) rather than a dirty one, as the clean cup is more appropriate for use or serving. The dirty cups (obj2 and obj5) are likely to be cleaned by Cameron, but the request is to hand a cup, which implies a usable, clean cup."
1,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" There are two forks: object 1 (dirty fork) and object 4 (clean fork). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Since Cameron is cleaning, it makes sense to hand the dirty fork (object 1) to be cleaned rather than the clean fork.

2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, it implies the fork is to be used or handled. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. The clean fork (obj2) is more appropriate to be handed over than the dirty fork (obj1) because the clean fork is ready for use or handling without causing contamination or extra cleaning. Therefore, the clean fork (obj2) is the correct object to hand over."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, obj7 is a dirty bowl, while obj1 is clean and obj2 is old but not specified as dirty. Therefore, the most appropriate bowl for Morgan to clean is the dirty bowl, obj7."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 2 (clean bowl) and object 5 (dirty bowl). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a bowl, it is more likely they want the clean bowl to use or handle rather than the dirty one, which they might be cleaning themselves. Also, Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the clean bowl (object 2) is the appropriate object to hand over."
6,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks for ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: a clean bowl (obj3), a dirty bowl (obj6), and a decorative bowl (obj7). According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no indication that any bowl is in use. Therefore, the dirty bowl (obj6) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 4 (clean plate) and object 6 (dirty plate). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant plate is the dirty one, object 6. Therefore, the plate being referred to is the dirty plate, object 6."
1,"Casey is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean dirty items. However, Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl,"" which implies a specific bowl is needed for the cleaning task. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Skyler is just handing the bowl, not using it. The clean bowl (object 1) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and ready to be used for cleaning or serving purposes, while the dirty bowls (objects 3 and 4) are not suitable. The decorative bowl (object 5) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean bowl (object 1) is the best choice."

Since Taylor is next to the objects and presumably using or holding them, and the request is simply to hand over the fork, the best choice is the clean fork (obj2) because it is clean and not decorative (Norm 4), and it is a fork. The dirty fork (obj4) is dirty but might be considered in use or not the intended object to hand over. The decorative fork (obj6) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean fork (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, the request is simply to hand the mug, not specifically to clean it. Since Morgan is cleaning, it is more appropriate to handle the clean mug (object 3) for serving or use, while the dirty mug (object 4) would be the one needing cleaning. The clean mug is the better choice to hand over as it is ready for use."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the plate, it implies the plate is not currently being used by Morgan and is available to be handled. The referring expression is ""the plate,"" which is ambiguous between the dirty plate (obj4) and the clean plate (obj5). Given that Morgan is cleaning and wants a plate, it is more logical that Morgan wants the clean plate (obj5) to serve or handle it properly, as the dirty plate (obj4) would be something to clean rather than hand over. Therefore, the target object is the clean plate (obj5)."

Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The dirty mugs (obj1 and obj2) are either dirty or decorative, but Norm 4 says in serving tasks to avoid decorative items, which is not the current task. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want to clean dirty mugs, but Riley is asked to hand ""the mug,"" and the clean mug (obj8) is the best candidate to hand over because it is clean and ready to be used or cleaned further. The dirty mugs might be more appropriate for cleaning, but the request is simply ""the mug,"" and the clean mug is the most straightforward choice to hand over."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7).

5,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 4).

Since Riley is next to multiple cups, including a clean cup (obj3), a decorative cup (obj2), and a dirty cup (obj6), and Morgan is asking for ""the cup,"" the best choice is the clean cup (obj3) because the dirty cup (obj6) is dirty and should be cleaned, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand it, implying Riley is holding or near it. The decorative cup (obj2) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean cup (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Bailey is next to the objects and presumably using or holding them, and Alex is the cleaner, Alex would want the clean cup (obj3) to use or handle, not the dirty cup (obj1) or decorative cup (obj7). The clean cup (obj3) is the most appropriate ""cup"" to hand over in this context, as it is clean and not decorative, aligning with the norms for cleaning and serving tasks. The dirty cup (obj1) is not suitable because it is dirty and should be cleaned by Alex, not handed over. The decorative cup (obj7) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task. Therefore, the clean cup (obj3) is the correct object to refer to as ""the cup."""

Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. Therefore, the clean mug (obj1) is the appropriate choice."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Skyler is next to all objects, but the clean plate (obj2) is not dirty and not decorative, and the dirty plate (obj1) is dirty but might be the one Casey wants to clean. However, since Casey is asking for ""the plate"" and the clean plate is more suitable for handing over (clean and not decorative), the best choice is the clean plate (obj2). The dirty plate (obj1) is dirty and should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over. The decorative plate (obj6) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate (obj2) is the most appropriate object to hand over."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: object 1 is clean, and object 2 is dirty. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the plate,"" the appropriate plate to hand over is the dirty plate (object 2)."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Skyler is next to both a clean cup (obj4) and dirty cups (obj3 and obj5), and the request is to hand ""the cup,"" it is most logical to hand the clean cup (obj4) because handing a dirty cup would imply using it, which conflicts with the cleaning task norms. Also, Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but none of the cups are hazards. Therefore, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs present, obj3 is a dirty mug, obj2 is clean, obj5 is old (not necessarily dirty), and obj7 is decorative. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated with mugs. Therefore, the most appropriate mug to hand over for cleaning is the dirty mug, obj3."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the objects, there are two bowls: one clean (obj3) and one dirty (obj5). Since Morgan is cleaning, the dirty bowl (obj5) is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. The clean bowl (obj3) is not appropriate for cleaning, and the other objects are not bowls. Therefore, the target object is obj5."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: object 2 (dirty bowl) and object 6 (clean bowl). Since the task is cleaning, Norm 2 states to clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the relevant bowl to hand over is the dirty bowl (object 2), as it is the one that needs cleaning."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: object 3 (clean spoon) and object 5 (dirty spoon). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant spoon is the dirty one (object 5). Therefore, the target object is the dirty spoon, object 5."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the forks, obj2 is clean, obj3 is dirty, and obj7 is decorative. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. The decorative fork (obj7) should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean fork (obj2) does not need cleaning."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Bailey is next to the objects and the request is to hand a cup, the clean cup (object 3) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty cup (object 1) is likely to be cleaned by Alex but not handed over. Also, the clean cup is not dirty and is a kitchen item, making it suitable for handling in this context."
3,"Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" Among the objects, obj3 is a bowl, and obj4 is a decorative bowl. According to Norm 4, in a serving task, decorative items should not be used. Therefore, the correct object to serve with is the clean, non-decorative bowl, which is obj3."

There is no indication of hazards or cleaning tasks, so the simplest interpretation is to pick up the pen."
4,"Morgan tells Riley to ""pick it up"" in the living room where several objects are on the floor, including a book, spatulon, lamp, and a broken mug.

The plant is less likely to be ""picked up"" as it is a larger item and possibly decorative, and the laptop is a valuable electronic device that might not be casually picked up without context. Therefore, the pen on the floor (obj2) is the most plausible referent for ""pick it up."""

The banana peel on the floor is a slipping hazard and should be picked up first."
3,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to removing a hazard. Among the objects on the floor, the lamp is a potential hazard because it is on the floor and could cause someone to trip or break. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The wet rag and broom are not hazards, and the book is less hazardous than the lamp.

Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag (obj5) is likely a hazard or dirty item that should be picked up first according to Norm 6 and Norm 7, which prioritize cleaning up hazards. The wet rag is more likely to be a hazard or mess compared to the spatulon, notebook, or book. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."
2,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up,"" which implies Riley should pick up an object from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag (obj2) is likely the priority to pick up because it is a hazard (wet rag on the floor can cause slipping).

1,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in the kitchen where multiple objects are on the floor, including a shard of glass, pen, lamp, broom, and notebook. According to Norm 7 and Norm 6, in general and cleaning tasks, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. A shard of glass on the floor is a hazard that can cause injury, so Skyler should pick up the shard of glass first."
1,"The command ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting likely refers to removing an object from the floor to maintain cleanliness and safety. Among the objects on the floor, the spatulon (a kitchen tool) is the most relevant to the restaurant context and is likely considered a hazard or misplaced item that should be picked up. The laptop, notebook, and pen are personal or non-kitchen items and less likely to be the intended object. The plant is on the table and not on the floor, so it is not relevant. Therefore, the spatulon on the floor is the object Jordan is referring to."
1,"The command ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to an object on the floor that should be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor, the broom (obj1) is a cleaning tool and not something to be picked up as trash or clutter. The notebook (obj2) and spatulon (obj3) are items that could be personal or kitchen-related, but the spatulon is misspelled and likely meant to be ""spatula,"" which is a kitchen tool. The wet rag (obj5) is also on the floor and could be considered dirty or a hazard. However, the broom is the most obvious object to pick up to clean or tidy the area, as it is a tool used for cleaning and is currently on the floor, which is unusual. Therefore, the broom is the most logical object for Taylor to pick up."
2,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting likely refers to removing something from the floor to maintain cleanliness and safety. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag (obj2) is a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7.

Therefore, Taylor should pick up the wet rag."
2,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall setting likely refers to removing a hazard or an item that should not be on the floor.

1,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the context of a living room and the objects present suggests prioritizing a hazard or something that needs cleaning up. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. The wet rag on the floor (obj1) is likely a hazard (wet rag on the floor can cause slipping), so Bailey should pick it up first. Other objects like the book, pen, broom, and spatulon are less urgent or not hazards."
4,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in the banquet hall. Among the objects, the laptop (obj4) is on the floor, which is an unusual and potentially hazardous location for such an item. Norm 7 states that in general, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or tidying. Picking up the laptop from the floor aligns with removing a hazard or misplaced valuable item. Other objects are on tables or the floor but are less likely to be hazards or require immediate attention. Therefore, the laptop on the floor is the most reasonable object to pick up."
3,"The command ""pick it up"" is given by Jordan to Taylor in the living room. Among the objects on the floor near Taylor, the spatulon (obj3) is the most likely candidate to be picked up because it is a kitchen tool that is out of place on the floor and should be tidied up. The plant (obj1) and laptop (obj5) are also on the floor, but the plant is likely decorative and the laptop is a valuable electronic device that might not be casually picked up without more context. The spatulon is a small kitchen tool that should be picked up to keep the area tidy and safe. The pen and lamp are on the table, so they are less likely to be the referent of ""pick it up"" when Taylor is next to the floor objects."
4,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to removing a hazard or something that needs tidying. Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel (obj4) is a clear hazard that could cause someone to slip. Norm 7 states that in general, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal.

The laptop and spatulon are also on the floor, but a laptop is valuable and might not be casually picked up without more context, and a spatulon (likely a spatula) is a kitchen tool, but the setting is a living room, so it is less likely the intended object. The pen is the most straightforward and typical object to pick up in this context."

2,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object that is out of place or on the floor, as items on tables are generally considered to be in their proper place. Among the objects, the laptop (obj2) and lamp (obj3) are on the floor. Since a laptop on the floor is more likely to be considered out of place and needing to be picked up than a lamp, which might be on the floor for a reason, the most reasonable choice is the laptop (obj2)."
5,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the kitchen context likely refers to removing a hazard or cleaning up. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag (obj5) is the most relevant to pick up because it is a cleaning item and could be considered a hazard or mess to be tidied.

The notebook, lamp, plant, and wet rag are less likely to be the intended object to pick up in this context, especially since the lamp and plant might be decorative or fragile, and the wet rag might be considered dirty but less of a hazard. Therefore, the broom is the most reasonable object to pick up."
4,"Casey says to Skyler ""pick it up"" in the kitchen setting. According to Norm 7, in general, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning up. The shard of glass on the floor is a hazard, so Skyler should pick up the shard of glass (object 4) to prevent danger."

2,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler, who is next to multiple objects on the floor. According to the norms, in a tidying or cleaning context, one should prioritize picking up hazards or dirty items. While the scene does not explicitly state any hazards or dirtiness, the laptop on the floor (obj2) is a valuable and potentially hazardous item to leave on the floor, as it could be damaged or cause tripping. The broom (obj3) is on the table, so it is not the target. The other items (notebook, book, pen) are less critical. Therefore, the most reasonable object to pick up is the laptop (obj2)."
4,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to removing a hazard or mess. Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel (obj4) is a clear hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning up to prevent accidents, following Norm 6 and Norm 7 about prioritizing hazards."

3,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler, who is next to several objects. Among these, the wet rag on the floor is a hazard and dirty item that should be prioritized for cleaning or tidying up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The lamp on the floor could also be a hazard, but a wet rag is more clearly a cleaning priority. The other items are on the table and not hazards. Therefore, the object to pick up is the wet rag on the floor (object 3)."
3,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is ambiguous, but given the norms, the priority is to pick up hazards first. Among the objects on the floor, the knife (obj3) is a potential hazard that should be picked up to prevent danger. Other objects on the floor like the pen and lamp are less hazardous. Therefore, the knife is the most appropriate object to pick up."

Therefore, the knife is the object that Charlie should pick up."
4,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in the kitchen, which implies a cleaning or tidying task. According to Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2, hazards or dirty items on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or picking up. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag (obj4) is likely dirty or a hazard (wet rag on the floor can be slippery or dirty), so it should be picked up first. Other items like the plant, lamp, and notebook are less likely hazards or dirty. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."
5,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up,"" and Riley is next to several objects on the floor, including a broken mug. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as broken items on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken mug represents a hazard, so Riley should pick up the broken mug (object 5)."
5,"Given the scene in a banquet hall and the instruction ""pick it up,"" the most urgent and normatively prioritized object to pick up is the knife on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a knife on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent danger.

Other objects like the book, lamp, and pen are not hazards. The spatulon is on the table and not on the floor, so it is less likely to be the object referred to by ""pick it up"" in this context. Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
4,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler, who is next to several objects on the floor and table. Among these, the broken mug (obj4) is a hazard because it is broken and on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. Even though the task is not explicitly stated as cleaning, the instruction to ""pick it up"" likely refers to removing the hazard. Therefore, the broken mug is the most appropriate object to pick up."
2,"Casey says ""pick it up,"" which implies Skyler should pick up an object from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, there is a knife (obj2) and a pen (obj5). According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or picking up. A knife on the floor is a hazard, while a pen is not. Therefore, Skyler should pick up the knife (obj2) to prevent danger."
1,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting. Among the objects on the floor, the broom is a cleaning tool and likely represents a hazard or something that should be tidied up. The laptop and book on the floor could be personal items but are less likely to be the intended object to pick up in this context. The broom is the most plausible object to pick up because it is a cleaning tool on the floor, which aligns with the norm to prioritize cleaning hazards or items on the floor in a tidying or cleaning context."
4,"The command ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object on the floor that should be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor, the broom (obj4) is a cleaning tool and is appropriate to pick up for tidying or cleaning tasks. The knife (obj2) on the floor is a hazard and should be prioritized for removal, but since the instruction is simply ""pick it up"" without specifying hazard removal, the broom is a more suitable and safe choice for the listener to pick up.

Among the objects on the floor, the spatulon (obj4) is a kitchen tool and is more relevant to the kitchen setting than the laptop, pen, or book. The broom is on the table, so it is not the target. Since the spatulon is on the floor and presumably out of place, it makes sense to pick it up to tidy the kitchen."
4,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley in the living room where Riley is next to several objects including a broken plate on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since the broken plate is a hazard and is on the floor, it is the most appropriate object for Riley to pick up."
1,"Casey says to Skyler ""pick it up"" in the living room. Among the objects, the pen (obj1), laptop (obj4), and book (obj5) are on the floor, so they are candidates for picking up. The pen is a small, easily picked-up item and is likely to be considered a hazard or clutter on the floor. The laptop and book are larger and may be more cumbersome. Given the norm that in tidying or cleaning tasks, hazards or items on the floor should be prioritized, and since the pen is on the floor and likely to be considered clutter, the pen (obj1) is the most reasonable object to pick up."

3,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in a restaurant setting. Among the objects on the floor, the broom (obj3) is a cleaning tool and likely useful to pick up to tidy the area. The lamp (obj1) and laptop (obj4) are valuable items but not typically picked up casually, and the notebook (obj2) might be personal. The plant (obj5) is on the table, so not relevant. Given the norms, picking up the broom aligns with tidying or cleaning tasks, and it is on the floor, so it makes sense to pick it up to clean or organize the space."
5,"Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up"" in the dining room where there is a shard of glass on the floor.

2,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting. The objects on the floor are a book, laptop, pen, and notebook. Among these, the laptop (obj2) is the most important to pick up because it is a valuable electronic device that could be damaged if left on the floor. The book, pen, and notebook are less critical and more common to be on the floor temporarily. Picking up the laptop prevents potential damage and hazard, aligning with the norm to prioritize hazards or valuable items on the floor."
2,"The command ""pick it up"" is given by Alex to Bailey in the living room. Among the objects, the laptop (obj2) and notebook (obj3) are on the floor, as is the lamp (obj5). The book (obj1) and spatulon (obj4) are on the table. Since the instruction is to ""pick it up,"" it implies the object is on the floor and needs to be picked up. The laptop (obj2) is a valuable and commonly used item that is more likely to be the intended object to pick up compared to the notebook or lamp. The lamp on the floor might be a hazard, but since the instruction is simply ""pick it up"" without specifying hazard cleanup, the laptop is the most reasonable choice."
2,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object on the floor that needs to be removed, especially if it is a hazard. Among the objects on the floor, the knife (obj2) is a potential hazard that should be prioritized for picking up to prevent danger, following Norm 6 and Norm 7 about prioritizing hazards.

1,"The command ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object on the floor that should be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor, the notebook (obj1) is a common item that one would pick up to tidy or prevent damage. The lamp (obj3) and laptop (obj5) are also on the floor, but picking up a notebook is more typical and less fragile than a lamp or laptop. The broom (obj4) is a tool, not something to pick up as an item to tidy. The plant (obj2) is on the table, so it is not the target. Therefore, the notebook (obj1) is the most reasonable object to pick up."
1,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in a restaurant setting. Among the objects on the floor, the broken mug (obj1) is a hazard (split property) and should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7.

3,"The phrase ""pick it up"" implies an object on the floor that needs to be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor (book, plant, laptop), the book is the most likely candidate for being picked up in a dining room setting, as it is an item that is out of place and should be tidied. The plant and laptop are less likely to be referred to as ""it"" to pick up, especially since the plant is a larger item and the laptop is valuable and might not be casually picked up. Therefore, the book (object 3) is the most reasonable choice."

1,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a kitchen setting likely refers to removing a hazard or an item that should not be left on the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the knife (obj1) is a potential hazard that should be prioritized for picking up to ensure safety. The pen and broom are less critical, and the spatulon (likely a spatula) is a kitchen tool but not a hazard. The book is on the table, so it is not relevant. Therefore, the knife is the most appropriate object to pick up."
5,"The command ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall setting likely refers to tidying or cleaning. Among the objects on the floor, the broom (obj5) is a cleaning tool and not a personal item like a book, laptop, or pen. Picking up the broom aligns with tidying or cleaning tasks, as it is used to clean the floor. The other items are personal or decorative and less likely to be the intended object to pick up in this context."
2,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in the kitchen setting. Among the objects on the floor, the shard of glass represents a hazard (broken glass). According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. Therefore, the shard of glass (object 2) is the most appropriate object for Riley to pick up."
1,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context, with multiple objects on the floor, prioritizes removing hazards first according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The broken mug (obj1) is a hazard because it is split and on the floor, posing a danger. Therefore, Bailey should pick up the broken mug to prevent harm."
5,"Jordan says ""pick it up"" to Taylor in the dining room, and among the objects on the floor, the broken mug (obj5) represents a hazard (split mug on the floor). According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. Therefore, Taylor should pick up the broken mug to prevent danger."
2,"The command ""pick it up"" likely refers to an object on the floor since objects on the table are already at a convenient height and less likely to need picking up. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, lamp, plant), the laptop (obj2) is a common item that one might be asked to pick up, possibly because it is out of place or at risk of damage. The lamp and plant are less likely to be casually picked up without further instruction. Therefore, the most reasonable choice is the laptop on the floor (obj2)."
2,"The phrase ""pick it up"" typically refers to removing something from the floor or ground, especially if it is a hazard. Among the objects listed, the shard of glass on the floor is a hazard that should be prioritized for picking up to prevent injury. Therefore, the shard of glass (object 2) is the most appropriate object for Charlie to pick up."
3,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the garden context likely refers to an object that needs to be removed for safety or tidiness. Among the objects on the floor, the broken mug (obj3) is a hazard due to being split and on the floor. Norm 7 states that hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. Therefore, the broken mug is the most appropriate object for Bailey to pick up."
1,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in the kitchen, where multiple objects are on the floor. Among these, the broom is a cleaning tool and picking it up aligns with tidying or cleaning norms. The broom is not decorative, not a personal item like a laptop or notebook, and is likely intended to be used for cleaning. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning up hazards, and a broom on the floor could be a tripping hazard. Therefore, the best object to pick up is the broom (obj1)."
4,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up,"" and Riley is next to several objects, including a laptop and a lamp on the floor. Since the setting is a banquet hall and the instruction is to pick something up, it is most logical to pick up an object that is on the floor and potentially out of place or a hazard. The laptop on the floor (obj4) is more likely to be important and in need of being picked up than the lamp (obj5), which might be heavier or less likely to be moved by a person. The laptop is also a valuable item that should not be left on the floor. Therefore, the object Riley is being asked to pick up is the laptop (obj4)."
5,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object on the floor that should be removed for safety or tidiness. Among the objects on the floor, the knife (obj5) is a potential hazard, so it should be prioritized for picking up to prevent danger, following Norm 6 and Norm 7."
4,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context suggests removing an item from the floor. Among the objects, the wet rag (obj4) is likely dirty or a hazard (wet rag on the floor can be slippery or messy), so according to Norm 7 (prioritize cleaning hazards) and Norm 2 (clean dirty items), the wet rag should be picked up first."
5,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to removing a hazard. Among the objects on the floor, the shard of glass is a hazard that should be prioritized for cleanup according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. Therefore, Bailey should pick up the shard of glass."
2,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to removing a hazard or mess from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel (obj2) is a clear hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The plant, broom, and lamp are not hazards, and the spatulon is on the table, so it is not relevant. Therefore, Taylor should pick up the banana peel to prevent danger."
4,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to an object that needs immediate attention or removal, especially something hazardous. Among the objects listed, the shard of glass on the floor is a hazard that should be prioritized for picking up to prevent injury. Norm 6 and Norm 7 emphasize prioritizing cleaning up hazards. Therefore, the shard of glass (object 4) is the most appropriate object for Bailey to pick up."
3,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context suggests removing an object from the floor to tidy or prevent hazards. Among the objects on the floor, the knife (obj3) is a potential hazard due to its sharpness and danger. Norm 7 states that hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. Therefore, the knife on the floor is the most appropriate object for Bailey to pick up."
4,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is given in a dining room setting where multiple objects are on the floor. Among the objects, the spatulon (obj4) is a kitchen tool, which is more relevant to the dining room context compared to a lamp, book, notebook, or laptop. Since the spatulon is on the floor, it is likely out of place and should be picked up. The other items are less likely to be intended for immediate picking up in this context, especially since the spatulon is a kitchen-related item and more relevant to the dining room environment."
5,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to removing a hazard. Among the objects on the floor, the shard of glass is a clear hazard that should be prioritized for cleanup according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. Therefore, the shard of glass (object 5) is the appropriate object to pick up."
5,"Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up"" in the garden where several objects are on the floor, including a book, lamp, pen, and banana peel. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The banana peel on the floor is a clear hazard as it can cause slipping or injury. Therefore, the object being referred to is the banana peel (object 5)."
2,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley, who is next to several objects including a knife on the floor. According to Norm 7 and Norm 6, hazards such as a knife on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent danger. Since the knife on the floor is a hazard, Riley should pick it up to remove the danger."
5,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is given in the dining room where there are several objects on the floor, including a lamp, broom, book, and a broken mug. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as broken items on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken mug (obj5) represents a hazard, so Bailey should pick it up first to prevent danger."
2,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting. Among the objects on the floor, the broom is a cleaning tool and likely not a hazard, but the lamp on the floor could be a hazard if it is broken or in the way. However, since the lamp is not specified as broken, the broom is the most reasonable object to pick up to clean or tidy the area. The pen is on the table, so it is not something to pick up from the floor. The notebook and laptop on the floor might be personal items and not necessarily hazards or cleaning targets. Therefore, the broom (object 2) is the most appropriate object to pick up in this context."
5,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object that needs immediate attention. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken plate (obj5) is a hazard on the floor, so Bailey should pick it up first."
3,"The command ""pick it up"" is given in the dining room where Taylor is next to several objects, some on the floor and one on the table. Since the instruction is to pick something up and the spatulon (object 3) is on the floor, it is the most likely target for picking up, as items on the floor are typically tidied or picked up first. The pen is on the table and likely does not need to be picked up, and the other objects (lamp, notebook, laptop) are also on the floor but the spatulon is a kitchen-related item, which fits the context of a dining room better than the pen or electronic devices. Therefore, object 3 (spatulon) is the best choice."
1,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in the garden where several objects are on the floor and table. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or picking up. The banana peel on the floor (obj1) is a hazard because it can cause slipping. Other objects like the notebook and book on the floor are not hazards. Therefore, the object to pick up is the banana peel (obj1)."
4,"Given the command ""pick it up"" and the scene in the garden with several objects on the floor, the most urgent object to pick up is the knife (obj4) because it represents a potential hazard. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The lamp, broom, and notebook are less hazardous, and the plant is on the table, so it is not relevant to ""pick up"" from the floor. Therefore, the knife on the floor is the object Taylor should pick up."
5,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the garden context likely refers to an object that needs immediate attention or removal. Among the objects listed, the broken plate on the floor (obj5) represents a hazard, which should be prioritized for cleaning or removal according to Norm 6 and Norm 7.

5,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" in the kitchen scene where Riley is next to several objects on the floor and table. Among these objects, the broken mug (obj5) on the floor represents a hazard (broken item on the floor). According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. Since the broken mug is a hazard, Riley should pick it up first to prevent danger."
2,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to removing a hazard or something that should not be left on the floor. Among the objects near Bailey, the shard of glass on the floor (obj2) is a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The lamp on the floor (obj1) and spatulon (obj5) are not hazards, and the notebook and book are on the table or floor but are not hazards. Therefore, the shard of glass is the most appropriate object to pick up."
5,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to removing a hazard or something that should not be left on the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel (obj5) is a hazard because it can cause someone to slip and fall. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The spatulon (obj1) on the floor is not necessarily a hazard, and the other objects are on the table. Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object for Taylor to pick up."
2,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting implies tidying up an item from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the spatulon (obj2) is a kitchen tool and likely relevant to the restaurant context. The pen, laptop, book, and lamp are less relevant or potentially personal or decorative items. Since the spatulon is a kitchen item and on the floor, it is a priority to pick it up to maintain cleanliness and safety in the restaurant environment."
1,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the kitchen context likely refers to an item on the floor that needs to be cleaned or removed. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag (obj1) is a cleaning-related item and could be considered a hazard or something that should be tidied up. The plant and lamp on the floor might be decorative or less likely to be the intended target. The book is on the table, so it is not the target. The broom is a tool for cleaning, not something to pick up. Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
5,"Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting. Among the objects, the wet rag on the floor (obj5) is a hazard and dirty, so according to Norm 7 and Norm 6, the priority is to clean up hazards. The wet rag on the floor is a hazard that should be picked up first."

According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. Picking up the knife from the floor prevents danger, so Riley should pick up the knife."
3,"The command ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall setting likely refers to an object on the floor that needs to be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, broom, pen), the broom is a cleaning tool and is likely intended to be picked up for cleaning purposes. The laptop and pen are personal or work items and less likely to be the target of a general ""pick it up"" command in this context. Therefore, the broom (object 3) is the most appropriate object to pick up."
4,"Casey says to Skyler ""pick it up,"" which implies a cleaning or tidying task. According to Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2, in a tidying or cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized. The wet rag on the floor (obj4) is a potential hazard (wet floor risk), so it should be picked up first before other objects like the pen on the floor or items on the table."
5,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to removing a hazard. Among the objects near Taylor, the shard of glass on the floor (obj5) is a hazard that should be prioritized for cleanup according to Norm 6 and Norm 7.

5,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in the garden setting. Among the objects, the wet rag on the floor (obj5) is the most likely candidate for picking up because it is on the floor and could be considered something that needs to be tidied or cleaned up. The pen and book are on the table and less likely to be referred to as ""pick it up"" in this context. The plant and lamp on the floor are less likely to be picked up casually, especially the lamp which might be heavy or fixed. The wet rag is an item that is out of place and likely needs to be picked up, consistent with norms about tidying or cleaning up hazards or messes. Therefore, the target object is obj5, the wet rag on the floor."

1,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the kitchen context likely refers to removing a hazard or mess. Among the objects, the banana peel on the floor is a hazard that should be cleaned up to prevent accidents. The lamp on the floor could also be a hazard, but a banana peel is a more immediate slipping hazard and more commonly something to be picked up. The book, spatulon, and notebook on the table are not hazards and do not need to be picked up urgently. Therefore, the banana peel on the floor (object 1) is the most appropriate object to pick up."
1,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley in the garden where several objects are present. Among these, the knife on the floor (obj1) represents a potential hazard, as knives on the ground can be dangerous. Norm 7 states that in general, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. Therefore, Riley should pick up the knife to prevent danger.

3,"Casey says ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting, and Skyler is next to several objects. Among these, the broken mug on the floor (obj3) represents a hazard (broken item on the floor). According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. Even though the task is not explicitly stated as cleaning, the command ""pick it up"" in this context most reasonably refers to removing the hazard to prevent danger. Therefore, the broken mug (obj3) is the object being referred to."
4,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to removing a hazard or an unusual item from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the lamp is an unusual and potentially hazardous item to have on the floor, compared to common items like a broom, pen, or wet rag. Norm 7 states that hazards should be prioritized for cleaning up. Therefore, the lamp (object 4) is the most reasonable object for Skyler to pick up."
4,"The command ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to an object on the floor that needs attention.

3,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object on the floor that should be tidied up. Among the objects on the floor, the lamp (obj3) is a hazard because it is fragile and on the floor, which aligns with Norm 6 and Norm 7 prioritizing cleaning hazards. The laptop and pen are less hazardous, and the spatulon is a kitchen tool, unlikely to be in the living room for use. The book is on the table, so it is not the target. Therefore, the lamp on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
5,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in the living room where several objects are on the floor, including a spatulon, lamp, book, pen, and a broken mug.

1,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is given by Jordan to Taylor in the living room, where multiple objects are on the floor: a pen, a book, a lamp, and a laptop. Among these, the pen is the smallest and most likely to be considered an item that should be tidied up quickly to prevent hazards such as tripping or losing it. The lamp and laptop are larger and more valuable, but the lamp on the floor could be a hazard; however, the pen is the simplest object to pick up immediately. The book and laptop might be in use or less urgent. Given the norms, prioritizing picking up small objects on the floor to prevent hazards aligns with Norm 7 (prioritize cleaning hazards) and Norm 2 (clean dirty items), but since no dirtiness is specified, the pen is the most reasonable object to pick up."
3,"The task is tidying in a library, and Alex says to Bailey ""pick it up."" According to Norm Conflict 2, in a tidying task, hazards should be prioritized over dirty items. Norm Conflict 3 specifies that in a library, dirty items on the floor should be prioritized over books and other objects. The dirty plate on the floor (object 3) is both dirty and a hazard, so it should be picked up first. The notebook on the floor (object 2) is dirty but less hazardous, and the lamp (object 1) and broom (object 4) are not dirty or hazardous. Therefore, object 3 is the correct choice."
2,"The task is tidying in a library, and Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up."" According to Norm Conflict 3, in a tidying task in a library, priority is given to removing dirty items from the floor over books and other objects.

2,"The task is tidying in a library, and Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to the norms, in a tidying task, hazards and dirty items on the floor should be prioritized. Among the objects on the floor, the trash (obj2) is the most likely hazard or dirty item compared to the pen and pencil. Therefore, Taylor should pick up the trash."
2,"The task is tidying in a library. According to Norm Conflict 3, in a tidying task in a library, priority is given to removing dirty items from the floor over books and other objects. The garbage bag on the floor (object 2) represents dirty or trash items and is on the floor, making it a priority to pick up. The book on the floor (object 1) is not dirty, and the vase and folder are on the table, so they are less relevant for tidying. Therefore, the object to pick up is the garbage bag (object 2)."

2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan is instructing Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized.

4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize cleaning hazards.

5,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards such as a shard of glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The shard of glass is a hazard, so Bailey should pick up object 5."

Therefore, the banana peel is the object Skyler should pick up."
4,"The task is cleaning, and Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized.

1,"The task is cleaning, and Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized. Among the objects on the floor, the broom (obj1) is a cleaning tool and not a hazard, but the lamp (obj2) on the floor could be a hazard if broken or in the way. However, the lamp is a decorative item and not typically cleaned up unless broken. The spatulon (obj3) is a kitchen tool, but it is on the floor and could be dirty. The laptop (obj4) on the floor is an electronic device and could be a hazard if stepped on or damaged. The book (obj5) is on the table, so it is not relevant for picking up from the floor. Given the norms, the priority is to pick up hazards or dirty items on the floor. The broom is a cleaning tool and likely clean, so it is not a priority. The lamp and laptop on the floor could be hazards. Between the lamp and laptop, the lamp is more likely to be a hazard on the floor. Therefore, the object to pick up is the broom (obj1) because it is the only cleaning tool on the floor and the instruction is to pick ""it"" up, likely referring to the broom as a tool to assist in cleaning."
1,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and tells Riley to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized.

Therefore, the book (object 5) is the most appropriate object to pick up."
3,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards such as a shard of glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup.

3,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards such as a broken mug on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning. The broken mug (obj3) is a hazard, while the book on the floor (obj1) is dirty but not a hazard. The spatulon, plant, and lamp are on the table and not dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the broken mug on the floor (obj3) is the object Taylor is being asked to pick up."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized.

3,"Morgan is cleaning and tells Riley to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The wet rag on the floor (obj3) is likely dirty and needs to be picked up. The lamp and plant are not dirty, and the broom is a cleaning tool, not something to pick up. The spatulon is on the table and unrelated to cleaning. Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the appropriate object to pick up."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards such as a broken mug on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup.

The broken mug (obj2) is a hazard, while the lamp, pen, and book are not hazards. The broom is on the table and not on the floor, so it is not the object to pick up. Therefore, the broken mug on the floor (obj2) is the object Riley should pick up."
2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The wet rag on the floor (obj2) is likely dirty and on the floor, making it a priority to pick up. Additionally, Norm 7 states that hazards should be prioritized in cleaning tasks.

Therefore, the pen on the floor (obj1) is the object Bailey is being asked to pick up."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and tells Riley to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards such as a shard of glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning. The shard of glass is a hazard and is on the floor, so Riley should pick it up."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized.

2,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up,"" which implies removing an item from the floor. According to Norm 2 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. There is no explicit hazard mentioned, so the next priority is to pick up dirty items on the floor. The objects on the floor are a laptop (obj1), notebook (obj2), and book (obj5). Among these, the notebook (obj2) is the most likely to be dirty or out of place compared to the laptop and book, which might be in use or less likely to be dirty. Also, Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, and the laptop might be in use. Therefore, the best choice is the notebook (obj2)."

Among the objects on the floor, the broom is a cleaning tool and not a hazard, but the plant, spatula, book, and laptop on the floor could be considered clutter or potential hazards. However, the broom is the most relevant object to pick up in a cleaning context because it is a tool that should be off the floor and ready for use. The plant and laptop are not typical cleaning priorities, and the spatula is a kitchen tool but less likely a hazard than the broom lying on the floor. Therefore, the broom (object 1) is the most appropriate object for Riley to pick up."

Among the objects on the floor, the broom (obj2) is a cleaning tool and likely not a hazard, but the laptop (obj3) and plant (obj4) on the floor could be hazards if left there. However, the broom is a tool that can be used to clean, and the spatulon (obj5) is a kitchen tool, which is irrelevant here. The notebook (obj1) is on the table, so not on the floor. Since the broom is on the floor and is a cleaning tool, it is the most logical object to pick up to continue cleaning. The laptop and plant are not typically cleaned or picked up by a cleaner unless they are hazards, but the broom is a cleaning tool that should be picked up to be used. Therefore, the best choice is object 2, the broom."
