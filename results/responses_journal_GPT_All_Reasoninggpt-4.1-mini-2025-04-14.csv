clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a plate, it is more likely they want a clean plate to use or handle rather than a dirty one. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the clean cup is being used or is a hazard. The old cup and dirty cups are dirty, but the old cup might be considered personal or not specified as a hazard. The decorative cup should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since Jordan is asking for ""the cup"" and the clean cup is the most straightforward, non-hazardous, and non-decorative cup available, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork, Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty fork is a hazard or being used, but since Charlie is next to both dirty and clean forks, and the request is simply to hand the fork (not specifically to clean it), the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over for use or cleaning. The dirty fork should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over immediately, especially if it might be considered hazardous or in use. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand to Cameron."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs present, there is a clean mug, a dirty mug, and an old mug. The clean mug is not appropriate for cleaning, and the old mug is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty mug fits the cleaning task best as it needs to be cleaned. Therefore, the dirty mug is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: a clean cup and a dirty cup. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant cup is the dirty cup. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is in use. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: a decorative fork and a dirty fork. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, they are not the focus in cleaning tasks either. The dirty fork is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the dirty fork is the correct object to hand over."
clean fork,"Since the task is cleaning and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork,"" Norm 2 suggests cleaning items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Here, Charlie is next to the items but not necessarily using any fork. However, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, which is irrelevant here. Given the request is simply to hand ""the fork"" and there are both clean and dirty forks present, the clean fork is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is ready for use and not dirty, aligning with the general preference to avoid spreading dirt during cleaning tasks."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards. Since the plate is being handed to Cameron, it implies it is intended for use or cleaning. The dirty plate is an option, but the clean plate is more likely the one to be handed for use or further cleaning steps. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned but not necessarily handed now. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to be referred to as ""the plate"" in this context."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Also, Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving or related tasks. The clean spoon (obj3) fits these criteria, while the dirty spoon (obj1) is not suitable for use, and the decorative spoon (obj6) should not be used. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative items. Since Morgan is asking for a mug to hand over, it implies the mug should be clean and usable, not dirty or decorative. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to refer to."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Although Morgan is cleaning, the request to hand a fork implies the need for a usable, clean fork rather than a dirty one. The dirty fork is not suitable for use, and the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over. Other objects like the plant, book, dirty plate, and lamp are irrelevant to the request for ""the fork."""
clean spoon,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, the request is simply to hand over a spoon, not necessarily to clean it. Among the spoons present, there is a dirty spoon and a clean spoon. The dirty spoon is likely to be avoided unless specifically asked for cleaning, and the clean spoon is more appropriate to hand over. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most suitable object to hand over in this context."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are two plates, one dirty and one clean, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty plate should be cleaned, not used or handed over. Therefore, the clean plate is the correct target object."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the fork,"" it implies the fork to be used or cleaned next. Among the forks, the clean fork is the most appropriate to hand over because it is not dirty or old, and handing a clean fork aligns with the practical use in cleaning or serving. The dirty and old forks are less likely to be handed for immediate use. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, since Morgan is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, the best choice is the clean cup, which is ready to be used or handled without violating norms. The decorative cup should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the dirty cup is likely to be cleaned rather than handed over. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Cameron is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items, and Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The decorative mug is not appropriate, and the dirty mugs and dirty spoon are not suitable because they are dirty and need cleaning. The clean mug is the only appropriate mug to hand over, as it is clean and not decorative, fitting the norms for a cleaning task."
clean plate,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are both a dirty plate and a clean plate present, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty plate should not be used or handled unless cleaning it, and since Casey is asking for ""the plate"" presumably to use or serve, the clean plate is the correct choice."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is to hand the plate, it implies using it rather than cleaning it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use, while the dirty plate should be cleaned."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a plate, it implies the plate is to be handled for cleaning or tidying. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is indicated here. Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and a clean plate. Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the plate, it is more practical to hand a clean plate rather than a dirty one to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. Also, the decorative plate is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a plate to be handed, not necessarily to be cleaned immediately. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving, so the decorative plate is excluded. Since Jordan is cleaning, and the request is to hand a plate, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is ready for use or further handling, while the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned rather than handed. Therefore, the clean plate is the best choice."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one dirty and one clean. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Jordan is asking for the bowl to hand over, it is more likely they want the clean bowl to use or continue cleaning with, as handing over a dirty bowl may not be appropriate. Also, Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, you should use clean tools, and while this is a cleaning task, the clean bowl is more suitable for handling. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to refer to."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Alex is asking for the spoon, it is most appropriate to hand over the clean spoon (Norm 3) because the dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Alex, and handing a clean spoon is more practical for use or further cleaning tasks. The used tissue and dirty bowl are not spoons, so they are irrelevant. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."
dirty mug,"Morgan is cleaning, and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a clean mug, and a decorative mug. The decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since Morgan is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty mug, as it needs cleaning. The clean mug does not need cleaning, so it is not the target. Therefore, the dirty mug is the object being referred to."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean dirty items. The request is for ""the bowl,"" and there are three bowls: a clean bowl, a dirty bowl, and a decorative bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative bowl is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no indication suggests the dirty bowl is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean spoon,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon,"" the norms for a cleaning task apply. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. There is no indication that the spoon is a hazard or in use. Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, a dirty spoon, and a decorative spoon. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative items are less relevant. Since the task is cleaning, and the request is to hand ""the spoon,"" the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is not dirty (so it doesn't need cleaning), and it is not decorative or hazardous. The dirty spoon should be cleaned, but handing it over as ""the spoon"" is less likely because it is dirty and the task is cleaning. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best fit for the request."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over a fork, it implies the fork is to be used, so it should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3). Among the forks present, there is a clean fork, an old fork, and a dirty fork. The clean fork is the appropriate choice to hand over for use, as the dirty and old forks are not suitable for immediate use. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to refer to."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate, a clean plate, and a decorative plate. The decorative plate should not be used in serving (Norm 4) and is not relevant here. The clean plate is not dirty, so it is less relevant for cleaning. The dirty plate fits the cleaning task best. Therefore, the ""plate"" referred to is the dirty plate."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty spoon is a hazard or currently in use. The decorative spoon should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a spoon, it is most appropriate to hand over the clean spoon, which can be used as a tool or for cleaning purposes, rather than the dirty spoon which is the object to be cleaned. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."

Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The clean mug is the only clean, non-decorative mug available, making it the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty mugs and decorative mug are not suitable for use in this context."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup,"" the most appropriate cup to hand over is the clean cup. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning dirty items that are not in use. However, since Cameron is asking for a cup to presumably use or handle, the clean cup is the best choice. The dirty cup and decorative cup are less suitable because the dirty cup is unclean and the decorative cup is not meant for use (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean cup is the correct object to refer to."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7).

There are two bowls: a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty bowl, as it needs to be cleaned. The clean bowl does not require cleaning and thus is not the target object."

dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: an old fork and a dirty fork. The old fork is not specified as dirty, so it is less relevant. The dirty fork fits the cleaning task better. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but here Casey is requesting a bowl to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning it immediately. Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a bowl, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is ready for use and not dirty or decorative. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned later, and the decorative bowl is not to be used. Therefore, the clean bowl is the correct target object."
clean bowl,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl,"" the choice should align with the cleaning task norms. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty bowl and a clean bowl present. The dirty bowl is the one that needs cleaning, but since Casey is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Skyler is next to both, the clean bowl is more likely the one to be handed over for use or further action. The dirty bowl is the one to be cleaned, but handing over the clean bowl aligns better with the request and the norms about not using dirty items directly. Therefore, the clean bowl is the target object."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty cups or old cup are hazards or currently in use. The clean cup is the only cup that is clean and suitable for use or handling without additional cleaning. Since Alex is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or old, and given the norms, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is ready for use and not a hazard or dirty item."
clean cup,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking for a cup to be handed, implying a usable, clean cup is needed.

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The dirty forks and old fork are dirty and candidates for cleaning, but since Jordan is asking for ""the fork"" without specifying dirty or old, and considering that the decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), the clean fork is the most appropriate to hand over for cleaning or use. Also, handing a clean fork is safer and more practical for the cleaning task, possibly to replace or handle it. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. The clean bowl is the only bowl that is clean and suitable for use. The old, dirty, and decorative bowls are either not clean or decorative, which should not be used in this context. Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 5). Among the cups present, the dirty cup is the most relevant object to clean. The clean cup should not be cleaned, the decorative cup should not be used, and the old cup is not specified as dirty. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). There are two spoons: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant spoon is the dirty one.

clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a mug to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning the mug itself. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task, so the focus is on cleanliness. Norm 1 and Norm 4 relate to serving tasks, which do not apply here. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want a clean mug to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty mug and decorative mug are less appropriate because the dirty mug is unclean and the decorative mug is not for use. The old mug is not specified as clean or dirty but is less relevant than the explicitly clean mug. Therefore, the clean mug is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is simply to hand over ""the spoon,"" and there are multiple spoons with different properties, the best choice is the clean spoon (obj7) because it is not dirty or decorative, and it is safe to handle. The dirty spoons are likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but Taylor handing over a clean spoon aligns with the norms of not touching dirty or decorative items unnecessarily and avoiding hazards."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 1 states that in serving tasks, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning.

dirty fork,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the focus should be on cleaning dirty items. Riley is asked to hand Morgan ""the fork,"" and among the forks present, the dirty fork is the relevant object to clean. The clean fork is not appropriate for cleaning tasks, and the decorative fork should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty fork is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."

clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 applies: cleaning tasks should focus on dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in cleaning tasks, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a spoon, it is more appropriate to hand over a clean spoon for use rather than a dirty one that needs cleaning. Also, Norm 1 and 4 do not apply here as this is not a serving task. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a mug, not specifying to clean it. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but this is a request to hand over an item. Among the mugs present, there is a clean mug, a dirty mug, and an old mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but since the task is cleaning, the clean mug is likely the one intended to be handled or passed. The dirty and old mugs are less likely to be referred to simply as ""the mug"" without qualifiers. Therefore, the clean mug is the most appropriate object being referred to."
clean cup,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1, in a serving or handing task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since there are both a clean cup and a dirty cup present, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over. Norm 2 and 5 about cleaning dirty items or not touching items in use do not apply here because the task is handing, not cleaning. Therefore, the clean cup is the correct choice."
clean mug,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking for a mug to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning the mug itself. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task, so the clean mug is likely the one intended for use or handling. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, so the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty mug and decorative mug are less suitable because the dirty mug is unclean and the decorative mug is not for use (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the most appropriate object to refer to as ""the mug"" in this context."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is asking for the plate to be handed over, it implies the plate is to be used or handled for cleaning or serving. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned, but since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the plate, it is more appropriate to hand the clean plate for use or further action. Therefore, the clean plate is the object being referred to."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: a dirty cup and a clean cup. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is in use. Therefore, the dirty cup is the correct choice."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" There are multiple bowls: an old bowl, a clean bowl, and a dirty bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and requests a bowl, it is most logical that Alex wants the clean bowl to use for cleaning or to avoid handling dirty or old bowls that might be hazardous or less useful. The clean bowl is the safest and most appropriate choice to hand over in this context."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Alex is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task you should not clean items currently being used by someone, it is likely Alex wants the clean bowl to use or handle rather than the dirty one. Also, Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazard is indicated here. The decorative bowl is excluded by Norm 4 for serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: one dirty and one clean. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty mug. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, the request is simply to hand over a fork, not necessarily to clean it. Given that there are both clean and dirty forks, and the task is cleaning, the clean fork is more appropriate to hand over for use or further cleaning, as the dirty fork should be cleaned first and may not be ready to be handed. Also, the clean fork is not decorative or hazardous, making it the suitable choice."
clean bowl,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting to be handed a bowl, likely to use it for cleaning or serving purposes. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking tasks. Since there are two bowls, one dirty and one clean, and the request is simply ""the bowl,"" the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use. The dirty bowl is less likely to be handed over for use during cleaning, as it would need to be cleaned first."
clean spoon,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is asking for a spoon, it implies they want a usable, clean spoon to continue their task. The decorative spoon should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the old spoon may not be suitable. The dirty spoon and dirty fork are dirty and should be cleaned but are not likely what Alex is requesting to hand over. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup,"" Norm 1 and Norm 2 guide the choice. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, which are not indicated here. The request is to hand a cup, implying use rather than cleaning it immediately. Norm 1 says to serve with clean kitchen items, and since the task is cleaning, but the request is to hand a cup, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over, as the dirty cup should be cleaned first and not handed for use."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. The dirty mug is likely dirty and needs cleaning, but the clean mug is also a mug present. However, since Alex is cleaning and asking for a mug, it is more appropriate to hand the clean mug to Alex for use or further cleaning tasks. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Alex directly, but handing the clean mug aligns with the request and norms."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a cup, it implies the cup should be clean and ready for use or handling, aligning with Norm 1 and Norm 3 that emphasize using clean kitchen items in serving or cooking tasks. The dirty cup and old cup are not appropriate because they are dirty or old, and the clean cup is the suitable object to hand over."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, so Jordan should be handed a spoon that is dirty to clean, not a clean or decorative one. Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, a decorative spoon, and a dirty spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" There are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but here the request is to hand over a mug, not necessarily to clean it. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but this is about handing over an item. Since the clean mug is more appropriate to handle and use (e.g., for serving or other purposes) and the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned, the clean mug is the correct referent. Also, the referring expression is ""the mug,"" which typically refers to the clean, usable one rather than the dirty one."
dirty spoon,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Riley is asked to hand over ""the spoon,"" and there are two spoons: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant spoon is the dirty spoon, as it is the object that needs cleaning."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a mug, it implies the mug should be clean to be used or handled safely. The dirty mugs and cups are likely to be cleaned by Morgan, but Riley is being asked to hand over a mug, which should be clean and ready for use or further cleaning. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most appropriate bowl to use is the clean bowl. Norm 1 and Norm 3 indicate that in serving or cooking tasks, clean kitchen items should be used. Although this is a cleaning task, the request is to hand over a bowl, likely for use or to assist in cleaning. The dirty and old bowls are not suitable because they are dirty or old, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest avoiding dirty items or items currently in use unless preventing danger. The clean bowl is the only suitable bowl to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Casey is asking for a mug, it implies the mug is to be used or cleaned by Casey. Among the mugs present, there is a decorative mug, a dirty mug, a clean mug, and an old mug. The decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned but may not be the one requested. The clean mug is the most appropriate choice to hand over because it is clean and ready for use or cleaning, aligning with the norms for cleaning tasks and the request. The old mug is less likely to be the intended object due to its age and possible condition. Therefore, the clean mug is the best fit for ""the mug"" Casey refers to."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, the referring expression is ""the mug,"" which is ambiguous between a clean mug and a dirty mug. Since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the mug, it is more likely that Jordan wants the clean mug to use or handle, rather than the dirty mug which should be cleaned. Also, Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either mug is in use. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). There are two dirty mugs (old mug and dirty mug) and one clean mug. However, the request is simply ""the mug,"" which likely refers to a clean mug suitable for use or handling without conflict. The clean mug is not dirty and not hazardous, making it the appropriate object to hand over in this context."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a mug, it is most logical that they want the clean mug to use or handle, not the dirty mugs which are to be cleaned. The clean mug is the only mug that is clean and not dirty or old, making it the appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to hand over should be clean, as per Norm 1 and Norm 3, which emphasize using clean kitchen items in serving or cooking tasks. Although the task is cleaning, handing a dirty cup would not be practical or hygienic. The clean cup is the best choice because it is not dirty, not decorative, and not a hazard, aligning with the norms for handling kitchen items during cleaning tasks."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the bowl"" and there are multiple bowls (clean, dirty, old), the clean bowl is the most appropriate to hand over because it is not dirty or old (which might be more hazardous or require cleaning), and it is likely the one intended for use or handling. The dirty and old bowls are more likely to be cleaned rather than handed over for immediate use."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: one clean and one dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean cup is not the priority for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Alex is asking for the mug, it implies they want to use it, so the mug should be clean to avoid contamination or additional cleaning. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over, as the dirty mugs are to be cleaned, not handed for use. The decorative mug is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean mug is the best choice."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply here because the task is cleaning, the best interpretation is that Cameron wants the clean plate to use or handle next. The dirty plate and decorative plate are less likely because the decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty plate is to be cleaned but not necessarily handed over now. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, a clean bowl, and a decorative bowl. The decorative bowl should not be used in cleaning (Norm 5 and 7), and the clean bowl is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is likely they want a clean fork to use or handle, not a dirty or old one. The dirty fork should be cleaned, but handing over a clean fork is more appropriate for use or further cleaning. The old fork is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks present, the dirty fork fits this criterion. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazard is mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to hand over should be clean, following Norm 1 and Norm 3 which emphasize using clean kitchen items in serving or related tasks. The dirty mug should not be handed over as it is not clean and is likely to be cleaned by Casey. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to refer to."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning.

clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a mug, it implies the mug is to be used or handled for cleaning or serving. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving. The decorative mug is excluded. The dirty mug and dirty spoon are dirty and likely need cleaning, but since Morgan is asking for ""the mug,"" the clean mug is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is ready for use and not decorative or dirty."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to hand over should be clean, as per Norm 1 and Norm 3 which emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks. Although the task is cleaning, handing a dirty mug would not be practical or hygienic. The clean mug is the only suitable mug to hand over, as the other mug is dirty and should be cleaned rather than used."
dirty fork,"Since Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the forks present, the dirty fork fits this criterion best. The clean fork should not be used for cleaning tasks, and the decorative fork should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The old fork is not specified as dirty, so the priority is the dirty fork. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the cup is being handed to Casey, it implies it is not currently being used. Among the cups, there is a decorative cup (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning), a clean cup, and a dirty cup. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty cup would be the natural choice to clean. However, Casey is asking for ""the cup,"" which likely refers to a clean cup to be used or handled, not the dirty one. Given the ambiguity, and that the task is cleaning, the best fit is the clean cup, as it is the only non-decorative, non-dirty cup that can be handed over without violating norms about handling dirty or decorative items unnecessarily."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate choice is a clean mug. Norm 1 states that in a serving task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 applies: cleaning tasks involve dealing with dirty items. However, Alex is asking for a mug to be handed to them, which implies use rather than cleaning the mug itself. The clean mug is the most suitable object to hand over because it is ready for use and not dirty or old.

Additionally, there is no indication that the dirty bowl is being used or is a hazard, so it is suitable to be handled in this cleaning task."
dirty plate,"Since the task is cleaning and Casey is asking Skyler to hand them ""the plate,"" the most relevant plate to hand over would be the dirty plate.

clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1).

clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but here Morgan is requesting a plate to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning. Since the task is cleaning, but the request is to hand a plate (likely for use or inspection), the best choice is a clean plate rather than a dirty or decorative one. The dirty plate and decorative plate are less appropriate because the dirty plate is to be cleaned, and the decorative plate is not to be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The clean plate is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup, the appropriate cup to use is the clean cup.

The clean fork is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and can be used as a tool for cleaning or handling other items without spreading dirt. The dirty fork should be cleaned, but handing the clean fork is more practical for the cleaning task. Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand."

Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, and by extension, in handling or serving tasks, clean items are preferred. Since Morgan is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is logical to select the clean fork rather than the dirty one, as the dirty fork would be for cleaning, not handing over.

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a plate, it implies the plate is to be used or handled for cleaning or serving. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. The dirty plate is less likely to be handed over for immediate use, and the clean plate fits the request better as it is ready for use or cleaning. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug, the appropriate mug to use is the clean mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in cleaning tasks, one should avoid using dirty or currently used items. The dirty mug is not suitable because it is dirty, and the decorative mug is not appropriate due to Norm 4. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct choice."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over a spoon, and there are two spoons (one clean and one dirty), the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over because it is ready for use and not dirty, aligning with the practical use in cleaning tasks where clean tools are preferred for handling or serving. The dirty spoon would be the one to clean, but handing over the clean spoon makes more sense for immediate use."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Since the request is to hand a plate, it implies the plate is to be used or handled for cleaning. Among the plates, the dirty plate is the one that needs cleaning, but handing a clean plate is more appropriate for use or serving. Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply here as the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Norm 4 excludes decorative plates in serving tasks, but this is cleaning. Given the ambiguity, the best fit is the clean plate, as it is the most neutral and likely intended object to be handed without violating norms about handling dirty or decorative items unnecessarily."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over a mug, and there are multiple mugs: a dirty mug, a clean mug, and a decorative mug. Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. The decorative mug is not appropriate to use. The dirty mug is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Alex is cleaning and asking Bailey to hand them a mug, it is more logical that Alex wants a clean mug to use or handle rather than a dirty one. Therefore, the clean mug is the best choice to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl and a clean bowl, as well as a decorative bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative bowl is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any bowl is being used. Therefore, the most appropriate bowl to hand over for cleaning is the dirty bowl."
clean fork,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork,"" the fork should be suitable for the cleaning task. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean. Also, Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Jordan is asking for a fork to be handed to them, likely as a tool or for use in cleaning, not to be cleaned themselves. The dirty fork and decorative fork are less appropriate because the dirty fork is contaminated and the decorative fork is not functional for cleaning. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1).

clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty bowls or old bowl are hazards or currently being used. The clean bowl is the only bowl that is clean and suitable for use or handling without conflict.

clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled next. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Morgan, but Riley is being asked to hand over a bowl, which suggests the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for use or further cleaning.

dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean dirty items. Among the objects, there are two forks: an old fork and a dirty fork. The dirty fork is explicitly marked as dirty, making it a priority for cleaning. The old fork is not marked as dirty, so it is less relevant. Therefore, the fork being referred to is the dirty fork."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Although there is a dirty plate present, it is more appropriate to use the clean plate for any serving or handling purposes during cleaning.

clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate.""

clean cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are dirty or currently being used by someone.

Among the mugs present, the dirty mug is the most relevant object to clean. The clean mug should not be used for cleaning (Norm 1 and 3), and the decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object Morgan is referring to."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the forks present, there is a decorative fork (which should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks per Norm 4) and a dirty fork. Since the task is cleaning and the fork is dirty, the appropriate object to refer to is the dirty fork."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. The referring expression is ""the mug,"" and among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, an old mug, a decorative mug, and a clean mug. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, one should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is being used. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The dirty mug fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and needs cleaning, unlike the clean or decorative mugs. The old mug is not specified as dirty, so the dirty mug is the most appropriate choice."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). However, the request is to hand over a mug, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a decorative mug, and a clean mug. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but here the task is cleaning, and the request is to hand over a mug. The clean mug is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and usable, while the dirty mug should be cleaned rather than handed over. Therefore, the clean mug is the best choice."
dirty spoon,"Since Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon, according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons present, there is a dirty spoon, a clean spoon, and a decorative spoon. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative spoon is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is in use. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" There are two mugs: a clean mug and a dirty mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for the mug, it is more appropriate to hand the clean mug to Cameron for use or further cleaning tasks. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned later, but the request is for ""the mug,"" which typically refers to the clean one unless specified. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to hand over."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Taylor is next to multiple plates (dirty, clean, decorative), and the request is simply ""the plate,"" the best choice is the clean plate because the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, and the decorative plate should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Also, the clean plate is not dirty or hazardous, so handing it to Jordan aligns with the request without violating norms. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for the fork, it implies they want to use it, so the fork should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3). The dirty fork and decorative fork are not appropriate because the dirty fork is unclean and the decorative fork is not for use (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork is the suitable object to hand over."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. The dirty cup and decorative cup are not appropriate for use, and the decorative cup should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean cup is the suitable object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: a decorative bowl and a dirty bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative bowl is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty bowl, as it is the bowl that needs cleaning."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, but here Morgan is requesting a spoon to be handed to them, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but there is no indication of hazard here. Since there are two spoons, one clean and one dirty, and Morgan is asking for ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty, the most reasonable interpretation is that Morgan wants the clean spoon to use or handle, not the dirty one. Therefore, the clean spoon is the target object."
dirty plate,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate, the relevant norm is to clean dirty items (Norm 2). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and a clean plate. The clean plate should not be cleaned or handled in a cleaning task, so the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over. The decorative plate is not suitable for cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the dirty plate is prioritized over other objects like the dirty mug or food items because the request specifically refers to ""the plate."""
clean bowl,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Jordan is asking for the bowl, it implies they want to use it for cleaning or another purpose. The dirty bowl is dirty and likely needs cleaning, but the clean bowl is more appropriate to hand over for use, as it is clean and ready for use. Therefore, the clean bowl is the correct object to hand over."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: a clean plate and a dirty plate. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant plate is the dirty plate, as it needs to be cleaned. Therefore, the object referred to as ""the plate"" in this context is the dirty plate."
dirty plate,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2).

Therefore, the dirty plate is the correct object to refer to in this cleaning context."
clean cup,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup,"" the most appropriate cup to hand over is the clean cup. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking tasks, and although this is a cleaning task, handing a dirty cup would not be helpful or hygienic. The dirty cups and plates are likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but when asked to hand a cup, the clean cup is the best choice."
clean fork,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork,"" the appropriate fork to use is the clean fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but here Cameron is requesting a fork to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning the fork itself. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, and by analogy, when handling items during cleaning, clean items are preferable to avoid contamination. The dirty fork should be cleaned, not handed for use. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to refer to."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a clean mug, and a decorative mug.

old plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. Among the plates, there is a dirty plate and an old plate. The old plate likely represents a hazard or an item needing special attention (e.g., broken or unusable), which aligns with Norm 6 and Norm 7 prioritizing hazards in cleaning. The dirty plate is also a candidate, but the old plate is more likely to be a hazard. The decorative plate should not be cleaned (Norm 5), and the clean plate is not appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, the old plate is the most suitable object Casey refers to."
clean fork,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Although there is a dirty fork present, it is more appropriate to use the clean fork for any task involving handling or serving. Additionally, Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that dirty items should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over if they are dirty, especially if the task is cleaning and not serving. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to refer to."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7).

The old mug is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty mug is the most appropriate object to be referred to in the cleaning task."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). However, handing over a mug implies using a clean item rather than a dirty one. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. Given the request is to hand over the mug, the clean mug is the appropriate object to use or serve, as the dirty mug would be for cleaning, not handing over. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct referent."
clean bowl,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most appropriate bowl to hand over is the clean bowl. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning dirty items but not necessarily handing over dirty items.

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is asking for a mug, it implies the mug is to be used, so it should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3). Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving or related tasks. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and not decorative, fitting the context of the request."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, an old spoon, a decorative spoon, and a dirty spoon. The clean spoon should not be used for cleaning (Norm 3), the decorative spoon should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the old spoon is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty spoon is the one that needs cleaning, so it is the most appropriate object to hand over for the cleaning task."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, a decorative spoon, and a dirty spoon. The decorative spoon should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the clean spoon does not need cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to refer to in this cleaning context."
dirty plate,"Since Cameron is cleaning, Norm 2 states that the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and a clean plate. The clean plate is not appropriate for cleaning, and the decorative plate should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty plate is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty spoon,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. Riley is asked to hand over ""the spoon,"" and among the spoons present, the dirty spoon is the one that needs cleaning. The clean spoon and old spoon do not fit the cleaning task as well as the dirty spoon does. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and an old plate. The dirty plate is explicitly marked as dirty, making it a priority for cleaning. The old plate might not necessarily be dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty plate is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty one. Therefore, the object referred to is the dirty bowl."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. There is no indication that the dirty plate or dirty mug is a hazard or currently being used. The decorative plate should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), but this is a cleaning task. Since Morgan is cleaning and asks for ""the plate,"" the most neutral and appropriate choice is the clean plate, as it is not dirty or decorative, and likely the intended object for cleaning or handling. The dirty plate is more likely to be cleaned, but since the request is simply ""the plate,"" the clean plate is the safest interpretation."
clean mug,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to use or handle should be clean according to Norm 1 and Norm 3, which prioritize using clean kitchen items in serving or cooking tasks. Although the task is cleaning, handing a clean mug is more practical and hygienic. The dirty and old mugs are less suitable because they are either dirty or old, and the clean mug is the best choice to fulfill the request without violating norms about cleanliness."
dirty plate,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the focus should be on cleaning dirty items. Riley is asked to hand Morgan ""the plate,"" and there are two plates: a clean plate and a dirty plate. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant plate is the dirty one. Norm 7 also prioritizes cleaning hazards, and a dirty plate is more likely to be a cleaning priority than a clean or decorative plate. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean plate is not the target in a cleaning task. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup,"" the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the cups present, the dirty cup is the most appropriate object to be handed over for cleaning. The clean cup and decorative cup are not priorities for cleaning, and the old cup is not specified as dirty. Therefore, the dirty cup is the correct choice."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to use is the clean one. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but since Casey is asking for a mug to hand over, it implies using a clean mug rather than a dirty one. Also, Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, so handing a clean mug is safer and more appropriate."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools, and Norm 2 states to clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a spoon to hand over, implying use rather than cleaning the spoon itself. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving or related tasks, so the decorative spoon is excluded. The dirty spoon is dirty and likely needs cleaning, so it is not appropriate to use it now. The clean spoon is the suitable choice for handing over during a cleaning task, as it is clean and usable."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the dirty spoon is dirty but not necessarily a hazard, and the decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for use in cleaning or handling. The clean spoon is the best choice because it is a spoon, is clean, and is not decorative or dirty, making it suitable for the task at hand."
clean mug,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for the mug to be handed to them, it implies the mug is to be used or handled. There are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. However, since Casey is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty, and Skyler is next to both mugs, the most reasonable interpretation is that Casey wants the clean mug, likely to use it or handle it safely. Therefore, the clean mug is the target object."
clean fork,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are two forks, one clean and one dirty, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over.

clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards.

clean spoon,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon, Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The referring expression is ""the spoon,"" and there are two spoons: one dirty and one clean. Given that Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the spoon, it is more likely that Alex wants the clean spoon to use or handle, as the dirty spoon is something to be cleaned rather than handed over. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to refer to."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2), but when referring to ""the spoon"" without any qualifier, the default is to pick the clean spoon to use or handle. The dirty spoon and decorative spoon are less likely to be referred to simply as ""the spoon"" without qualifiers. Also, the decorative spoon should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. Also, Norm 2 states that dirty items should be cleaned, but here the request is to hand a spoon, likely for use in cleaning or related activity, so a clean spoon is appropriate. The dirty spoon and decorative spoon are less suitable: the dirty spoon is not ideal to hand over for use, and the decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon is the best choice."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: a dirty bowl and a decorative bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, they are not the target in cleaning tasks unless they are dirty or hazardous. The decorative bowl is not dirty, so it is less relevant. The clean bowl is not dirty, so it is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most relevant bowl to hand over in a cleaning task is the dirty bowl.

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Alex is cleaning and requests a spoon, it is logical to hand over the clean spoon (obj6) rather than the dirty spoon (obj2), because the clean spoon is more appropriate for use or further cleaning tasks without contamination. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but Bailey handing over the clean spoon aligns with the norms for serving or assisting in cleaning without contaminating clean items."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here the request is to hand over a cup, not necessarily to clean it. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but this is about handing an item. The clean cup is the most straightforward and unambiguous referent for ""the cup"" since there are multiple cups but only one clean cup. The dirty cup and dirty mug are dirty and likely to be cleaned, but the clean cup is the best fit for the request to hand ""the cup"" without ambiguity or conflict with norms."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since there is no indication that the dirty plate is a hazard or currently being used, and the clean plate is available, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over for use or further cleaning. Additionally, handing over the clean plate aligns with Norm 1 and Norm 3, which emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks, which may be subsequent steps after cleaning."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a plate to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning.

The dirty plate and dirty spoon are to be cleaned, not handed for use. Therefore, the clean plate is the correct referent."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should prioritize cleaning dirty items but also avoid using items that are dirty or currently being used. However, since Alex is asking to be handed a mug, it implies the mug is to be used or handled. According to Norm 3, in a cooking or handling context, clean tools are preferred. Between the two mugs, one is clean and the other is dirty. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4).

The dirty mug should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over immediately, especially if it might be considered in use or for cleaning later. The decorative mug is excluded due to Norm 4. Therefore, the clean mug is the best fit for the request."

The dirty cup is likely to be the one needing cleaning, but since the clean cup is also present and the request is simply ""the cup,"" the clean cup is the safer and more appropriate choice to hand over without violating norms about touching others' dirty items. Therefore, the clean cup is the target object."
old plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). The old plate is likely considered a hazard or priority for cleaning over the dirty plate or clean plate. The dirty plate is also dirty but the old plate may represent a more urgent cleaning target, possibly broken or hazardous. The clean plate should not be cleaned (Norm 2), and decorative or non-plate items are irrelevant here. Therefore, the old plate is the most appropriate object to refer to as ""the plate"" in this cleaning context."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is cleaning and requests a spoon, it is most logical that they want a clean spoon to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but handing a dirty spoon may not be appropriate. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best choice to hand over."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" There are two plates: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the plate being referred to is the dirty plate, as it is the appropriate object to clean in this context."
dirty bowl,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most relevant bowl to choose is the dirty bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The clean bowl is not a priority for cleaning, and the decorative bowl should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to refer to."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is simply to hand ""the mug,"" and there are multiple mugs (clean mug, decorative mug, dirty mug), Norm 4 excludes decorative mugs in serving tasks but here the task is cleaning, so decorative mugs are not preferred. The dirty mug is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty, and the clean mug is available and not decorative or hazardous, the clean mug is the most appropriate object to hand over. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but the clean mug is the one to be handed as ""the mug"" in this context."
clean bowl,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Jordan is asking for the bowl, it implies they want a clean bowl to use or handle, not a dirty one. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, which aligns with choosing the clean bowl. The decorative bowl is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled, so it should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3). The dirty bowl and decorative bowl are less appropriate for handing over in this context. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most suitable object to be referred to as ""the bowl."""
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a clean mug, and a decorative mug. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative mug is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is in use. Therefore, the dirty mug is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Jordan is cleaning and asking for a plate, it is likely for use or inspection. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty, old, and decorative plates are either dirty or decorative, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving, but this is cleaning. The clean plate is the only plate that is clean and not decorative or dirty, so it is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or further use."
clean fork,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items rather than dirty ones. Although there is a dirty fork present, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean fork for use or further cleaning. Additionally, Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but since Casey is asking for the fork to be handed, the clean fork is the suitable object to hand over."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, there is a clean plate, a decorative plate, and a dirty plate. The decorative plate should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), and in cleaning tasks, one should not clean items currently being used unless preventing danger (Norm 5), but no usage is indicated here. The dirty plate is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the ""plate"" referred to is the dirty plate."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the dirty cup is dirty and presumably needs cleaning, but the clean cup is also present and is not dirty, the best choice for handing over is the clean cup, as it is ready for use and not a hazard. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty cup is likely to be cleaned by Casey themselves. Therefore, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty fork,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The dirty fork fits the cleaning task as it is dirty and a fork, whereas the clean fork is not the target for cleaning. The decorative fork should not be used or cleaned in this context. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: one dirty and one clean. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork is the dirty fork. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: a clean cup and a dirty cup. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant cup is the dirty cup. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean cup is not the focus for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug, the appropriate mug to use or handle is the clean mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items in serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning dirty items but not touching items currently in use unless preventing danger. Here, handing a clean mug aligns with the cleaning task without violating norms about handling dirty or in-use items."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: a dirty spoon and a decorative spoon. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, they are not the focus in cleaning tasks unless hazardous or dirty. The dirty spoon fits the cleaning task as it is dirty and a spoon, while the decorative spoon is not dirty and is decorative, so it is less relevant. The clean spoon is not dirty, so it does not need cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork,"" Norm 3 and Norm 2 guide the choice. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, which are not indicated here. Norm 3 says to use clean tools for tasks, and since Alex is cleaning, they likely want a clean fork to handle or use. The dirty fork is not appropriate to hand over for cleaning or use, so the clean fork is the correct object to hand."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the plate is clean and not dirty, and the dirty plate is also present, but the request is specifically for ""the plate,"" it implies the clean plate. Also, the clean plate is more likely to be the intended object to handle without causing conflict or hazard. Therefore, the clean plate is the correct object to hand over."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Alex is cleaning and requests a plate, it is likely for use in cleaning or handling. The dirty plate and dirty cup are dirty but may be intended for cleaning by Alex. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4). The clean plate is the safest and most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning purposes without violating norms about handling others' items or hazards. Therefore, the clean plate is the best choice."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7).

Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative items. However, since Casey is asking to be handed a mug (likely to use it for cleaning or related purposes), the clean mug is the appropriate choice because it is not dirty or decorative. The dirty mug should be cleaned but is not the one to be handed for immediate use. The decorative mug should not be used. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" the most appropriate mug to use or handle is the clean mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items during serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest avoiding dirty items or those currently in use during cleaning. The dirty mug and old mug are not suitable because they are dirty or old, and the clean mug is the best choice to hand over in this context."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate choice is a clean mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 indicate that in serving or cooking tasks, clean kitchen items should be used. Although the task is cleaning, handing a mug likely implies using a clean one rather than a dirty or old one. Dirty or used mugs are typically cleaned rather than handed over for use. Therefore, the clean mug is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the most appropriate choice is a clean mug. Norm 1 states that in a serving task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 3 applies: in a cooking or related task, clean tools are preferred. Also, Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" to be handed, it implies a tool to be used, not an item to be cleaned. The dirty mugs and old mug are likely to be cleaned, but the clean mug is the suitable object to hand over for use. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the best fit."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" Norm 1 and Norm 2 guide the choice. In a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but when handing an item, it is preferable to use clean items to avoid contamination or spreading dirt. There are two mugs: one dirty and one clean. The clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is ready for use or cleaning without risk. The dirty mug should be cleaned, not handed as is."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a bowl to be handed to them, implying the use of a clean bowl rather than a dirty or old one. Norm 3 also states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, and while this is a cleaning task, the request for ""the bowl"" likely refers to the clean bowl as the appropriate object to handle. The dirty and old bowls are not suitable for immediate use or handling, and the clean bowl is the most reasonable choice to be handed over."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, but since this is a cleaning task, the relevant norm is Norm 2 and Norm 5. Norm 2 says to clean items that are dirty, but Morgan is asking for a spoon to be handed, not to be cleaned. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but that is not directly relevant here. Norm 1 and Norm 4 apply to serving tasks, which is not the case. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want a clean spoon to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The decorative spoon is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or old, and there are multiple bowls (clean, dirty, old), the best choice is the clean bowl because it is the only bowl that is clean and presumably ready to be used or handled safely. The dirty and old bowls are less likely to be the intended object since they are not clean and may require cleaning first. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, the dirty bowl fits this criterion best. The clean bowl is not appropriate because it is already clean, and the decorative bowl should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). The old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so the priority is the dirty bowl. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most suitable object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled, so it should be clean to avoid contamination or further mess. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean bowl is the safest and most appropriate choice to handle. The dirty bowls and decorative bowl are less appropriate because dirty bowls should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over, and decorative bowls should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean bowl is the most suitable object to be handed over."
clean fork,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork, the norm for cleaning tasks (Norm 2) suggests focusing on dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. There is no indication that the fork is being used or hazardous. The decorative fork should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The old fork is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is ambiguous. The clean fork is the best choice because it is not decorative, not dirty, and likely safe to handle. Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand a cup, not necessarily to clean it immediately, and the dirty cups are likely to be cleaned by Morgan, Riley should hand a clean cup to Morgan to use or handle. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the old cup is not specified as dirty or clean but may not be ideal. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty cup,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the cups present, the dirty cup is the one that needs cleaning. The old cup and decorative cup are not specified as dirty, and the clean cup is already clean, so the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean and one dirty.

Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
old plate,"Jordan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean dirty items. The old plate is likely dirty or in need of cleaning, fitting the cleaning task. The dirty plate is also an option, but the old plate may be prioritized as it could be more of a hazard or more in need of cleaning. The clean plate and decorative plate are not appropriate for cleaning (Norm 3 and Norm 4). Therefore, the old plate is the most suitable object for Jordan to be referring to when asking for ""the plate"" in a cleaning context."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are multiple plates: a dirty plate, an old plate, and a clean plate. The dirty plate is the most relevant for cleaning, as the clean plate does not need cleaning, and the old plate may not be prioritized unless it is hazardous. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate, an old plate, and a clean plate. The clean plate should not be used for cleaning tasks (Norm 3). The old plate might be considered dirty or hazardous, but the dirty plate is explicitly marked as dirty and is a clear candidate for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate,"" the most appropriate plate to hand over is the clean plate. Norm 1 states that in a serving task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so the plate should be clean to avoid spreading dirt. Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but handing a dirty plate is not suitable. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate is the best choice to hand over."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the bowl is a hazard or currently in use. Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, a decorative bowl, an old bowl, and a clean bowl. Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here since the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving tasks, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none of the bowls are hazards. Norm Conflict 1 says not to touch items that aren't yours unless preventing danger, but no such conflict is indicated. Given that Casey is cleaning and asks for ""the bowl,"" the best choice is the dirty bowl, as it needs cleaning. However, since the request is to hand ""the bowl,"" and the dirty bowl is the one that needs cleaning, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items, and Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving or related tasks. The clean cup is the only cup that is clean and suitable for use. The dirty cups and mugs are not appropriate to hand over for use during cleaning, and the decorative cup should not be used. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl,"" the norm for a cleaning task is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). However, the request is to hand over the bowl, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. Given that handing over a clean item is more practical and aligns with Norm 1 (serve with clean items) and Norm 3 (cook with clean tools), and since the task is cleaning, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or further use. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned later, but the clean bowl is the better choice to hand over now."
clean mug,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items.

clean cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to hand over should be clean, as per Norm 1 and Norm 3 which emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks. Although the task is cleaning, handing a clean cup is logical because handing a dirty or old cup would not be useful or hygienic. The dirty cups and old cup are likely to be cleaned rather than handed over. The clean cup is the best fit for the request."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a bowl to be handed over, likely to use it for cleaning or another purpose. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but since the task is cleaning, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over rather than the dirty bowl or other unrelated objects. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Morgan, but the request is to hand ""the bowl,"" which implies the clean one is intended for use."
clean fork,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should avoid touching items that are dirty unless necessary and prioritize clean items for use. Among the two forks present, one is clean and the other is dirty. The clean fork is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it aligns with Norm 3 (using clean tools in tasks) and avoids handling dirty items unnecessarily."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a mug, it is most logical that Casey wants a clean mug to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The dirty mug and decorative mug are less appropriate because the decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned rather than handed over for use. Therefore, the clean mug is the best fit for the referring expression ""the mug"" in this context."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards.

The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty fork is not ideal for immediate use. Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean items should be used. However, since the task is cleaning (Norm 2), Morgan should focus on dirty items but only clean items that are safe and appropriate to handle. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty fork is likely to be cleaned by Morgan, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a fork, it implies a clean fork is needed for some purpose. The dirty fork is not appropriate to hand over directly, and the decorative fork is not for use. Therefore, the clean fork is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

Among the plates present, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to be handed for cleaning. The clean plate should not be used for cleaning, and the other objects are not plates. Therefore, the dirty plate is the correct choice."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, the dirty bowl is the most relevant object to hand over for cleaning. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean bowl does not need cleaning. The old bowl is not specified as dirty, so the priority is the dirty bowl."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, there is a clean plate, a decorative plate, an old plate, and a dirty plate. The decorative plate should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning. The old plate is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty plate is the one that needs cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate is the most appropriate object to refer to in this cleaning context."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" There are two plates: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the plate being referred to is the dirty plate, as it is the appropriate object to clean in this context."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The dirty plates and bowls are dirty and should be cleaned, but the request is specifically for ""the plate,"" which is singular and definite, suggesting a specific plate. The clean plate is the only plate that is not dirty or old, and it is likely the one intended for use or handling. Since the dirty plate and old plate are dirty or old and might be prioritized for cleaning, but the request is for ""the plate,"" the clean plate is the best fit as it is the only clean plate available to hand over, aligning with the norms for serving or handling clean items."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone, and Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, the best choice is the clean plate. The dirty plate and dirty fork are likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the plate, it implies the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are two mugs, one dirty and one clean, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. Additionally, Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that dirty items should be cleaned, but since Morgan is asking for a mug to be handed, it implies use rather than cleaning the mug itself. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct choice."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, an old bowl, a clean bowl, and a decorative bowl. The clean bowl should not be cleaned (Norm 2), the decorative bowl should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to refer to in this cleaning context."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to be referred to. Norm 5 also states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork is the correct choice."
dirty fork,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork, the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the forks present, the dirty fork is the one that needs cleaning. The decorative fork should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4), and the clean fork does not need cleaning. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to refer to in this cleaning context."
clean cup,"Casey is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking for a cup to be handed, implying a usable, clean cup is needed rather than a dirty one. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items. The decorative cup and dirty cups are not appropriate. The old cup might be questionable, but the clean cup is the best fit for handing over in this context."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Morgan is asking for a fork, it implies they want to use it, likely for cleaning or organizing. Between the two forks present—one dirty and one clean—the clean fork is the appropriate choice because it is not dirty and thus suitable for handling or serving. The dirty fork should be cleaned rather than handed over directly. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to refer to."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty mug. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is being used. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl,"" the appropriate bowl to use is the clean one. Norm 1 and Norm 3 indicate that for serving or cooking tasks, clean items should be used, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in cleaning tasks, dirty items should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over if they are dirty. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items, but that does not apply here. The clean bowl is the suitable object to hand over in this context."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty mug is a hazard or currently in use. The decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since Cameron is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, and considering that the clean mug is more appropriate for handling and use, the clean mug is the best choice to hand over. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned later, but handing the clean mug aligns with the norms for safe and appropriate handling."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to be handed for cleaning. The clean bowl is not relevant for cleaning, and the dirty plate is not a bowl. Other objects like calculator, pen, and notebook are not bowls. Hence, the dirty bowl is the correct choice."
clean plate,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate,"" Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. There is no indication the dirty plates are being used or hazardous. Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply as this is a cleaning task. The clean plate is the only plate that is not dirty and thus more appropriate to handle without causing conflict. Therefore, the clean plate is the best choice to hand over."
clean cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup,"" the norm for a cleaning task is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). However, handing over a cup implies it should be usable and clean, especially since the dirty cup is not specified as a hazard or priority for cleaning. The clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, aligning with the cleaning task without violating any norms."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, but since this is a cleaning task, the relevant norm is Norm 2 and Norm 5: you should clean items that are dirty but not touch items that aren't yours unless preventing danger. However, Morgan is asking for the fork to use, so the fork should be clean to be used. The dirty, old, and decorative forks are not suitable because dirty forks should be cleaned, old forks may be unusable, and decorative forks should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. However, the request is to hand a fork, not necessarily to clean it immediately. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty fork is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Alex is asking for ""the fork"" without specifying dirty or decorative, the best choice is the clean fork, which is suitable for use and not decorative or dirty. Therefore, Bailey should hand the clean fork."
dirty fork,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. Riley is asked to hand over ""the fork,"" and there are two forks: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork is the dirty one. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. However, since Morgan is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or old, and there are multiple mugs (dirty mug, old mug, clean mug), the most reasonable choice is the clean mug. This is because the clean mug is likely the one intended for use or handling, while the dirty and old mugs are presumably to be cleaned or discarded. Also, the clean mug is not dirty or hazardous, making it appropriate to hand over."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a plate, likely to use or inspect it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and since Morgan is cleaning, they might want a clean plate to avoid contamination or to place cleaned items on. The clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over, as the dirty and old plates are not suitable for immediate use, and the clean plate is the only clean plate available. Other objects like the throw pillow, magazine, and remote control are irrelevant to the request."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, there is a dirty cup, a clean cup, and a decorative cup. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative cup is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any cup is being used. Therefore, the dirty cup is the most appropriate object to refer to for cleaning."
clean cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to use or handle is the clean cup. Norm 1 and Norm 3 indicate that in serving or cooking tasks, clean items should be used, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest that dirty items should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over for use. Here, handing over a cup implies it should be clean and ready for use, so the clean cup is the correct referent."
clean fork,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork, the appropriate fork to use or handle would be the clean fork. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task you should use clean tools, and while this is a cleaning task, Norm 1 and Norm 3 imply that clean items are preferable for use. The dirty forks and old fork are not suitable because they are dirty or old, and the decorative fork should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, the dirty cup is the one that needs cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is being used. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, so Jordan is likely asking for a bowl that needs to be cleaned. Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, a decorative bowl, a clean bowl, and an old bowl. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that any bowl is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but none of the bowls are indicated as hazardous. The decorative bowl should not be used for cleaning (Norm 4). The clean bowl does not need cleaning. The old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object Jordan is referring to."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the fork is being handed to Casey, it implies it is not currently in use. Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork, a clean fork, and a decorative fork. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative forks are not relevant. Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want the dirty fork to clean it. However, the request is simply ""the fork,"" and the clean fork is more appropriate to hand over for use or cleaning because the dirty fork might be contaminated or hazardous. Given the norms and the context, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl and a dirty bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty bowl, as it needs to be cleaned. The clean bowl does not require cleaning and thus is not the target object."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand a plate, and there are multiple plates (clean, dirty, decorative), the best choice is the clean plate because it is not decorative (Norm 4) and is the most appropriate to hand over for cleaning or use. The dirty plate should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over immediately, and the decorative plate should not be used in cleaning or serving tasks. Therefore, the clean plate is the most suitable object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl, a dirty bowl, a decorative bowl, and an old bowl. The decorative bowl should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning.

clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Here, the dirty spoon is dirty but might be the object to clean, yet handing a clean spoon is more appropriate for use or handling without contamination. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). Since the request is to hand ""the spoon,"" the clean spoon is the best choice as it is ready for use and not dirty or decorative, aligning with the norms for handling spoons in this context."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. Also, Norm 2 states that in cleaning, dirty items should be cleaned, but here Jordan is asking for a spoon to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning the spoon itself. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but for handing over, the clean spoon is appropriate. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."
clean fork,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, but since this is a cleaning task, the focus is on cleaning dirty items (Norm 2). However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that any fork is hazardous or currently in use. The request is simply to hand over ""the fork,"" which typically implies the clean, usable fork rather than dirty, old, or decorative ones. The clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over in this context."
dirty plate,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the focus should be on cleaning dirty items. Riley is asked to hand Morgan ""the plate,"" and among the plates present, the dirty plate is the one that needs cleaning. The decorative plate should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4), and the clean plate does not require cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty bowl is the relevant object to be cleaned. The decorative bowl should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean bowl is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object Jordan is referring to."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" and there are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty mug. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty mug is in use. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty fork,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks for ""the fork,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork, a clean fork, an old fork, and a decorative fork. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Norm 4 excludes decorative forks in serving, but this is a cleaning task. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug and a clean mug. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty one. The decorative mug is excluded because it is decorative (Norm 4) and not specified as dirty. Therefore, the dirty mug is the object being referred to."

Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to use in this cleaning task is the clean mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning dirty items but not using dirty or hazardous items for serving or handing over. The dirty mug is not suitable because it is dirty, and the clean mug is the only appropriate choice to hand over in this context."
clean bowl,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty bowls are hazards or currently being used, but since Jordan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or old, and there are multiple bowls including dirty and clean ones, the safest choice is the clean bowl to avoid conflict with Norm 5 and because the clean bowl is more likely to be the one intended for handling or use. The dirty bowls might be prioritized for cleaning later, but the request is simply for ""the bowl,"" so the clean bowl is the best fit."
clean fork,"Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork"" during a cleaning task. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Alex is requesting a fork, likely to use it or handle it. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is asking for the fork, it implies they want the usable, clean fork rather than the dirty one. Also, Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, which aligns with choosing the clean fork. Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for a mug, it implies they want to use it or handle it. Among the mugs present, there is a clean mug, a decorative mug, a dirty mug, and an old mug. Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, and Norm 3 says in cooking tasks, tools should be clean. Here, since the task is cleaning and Casey is asking for ""the mug,"" the best choice is the clean mug, as it is the only mug suitable to be handed over without violating norms about handling dirty or decorative items. The dirty mug and dirty bowl are to be cleaned, but not handed over for use. The decorative mug is not appropriate to use. The old mug's condition is unclear but likely not preferred. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to hand over."
clean cup,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools, and Norm 2 states to clean dirty items. However, since Cameron is asking for ""the cup"" to hand over, it implies a tool to be used rather than an item to be cleaned. The clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and usable, unlike the dirty cup, decorative cup, or old cup. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty cup is not suitable for use in cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean cup is the best choice."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is asking for a fork to hand over, it implies a tool to assist in cleaning or handling, and Norm 3 says in cooking tasks use clean tools, but this is cleaning. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the old fork is not specified as clean or dirty but may be less suitable. The dirty forks are dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty fork may not be appropriate. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over for use in the cleaning task."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned, but since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the plate, it implies the plate to be used or handled next. Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but the task is cleaning. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4). Given the ambiguity, the best fit is the clean plate, as it is a plate and not decorative, and likely the one to be handled safely."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. Riley is asked to hand over ""the bowl,"" and there are two bowls: one dirty and one clean. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty bowl, as it is the one that needs cleaning. The clean bowl is not the target because it does not require cleaning."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the plate is being handed to Alex, it implies it is to be cleaned or used for cleaning purposes. The dirty plate is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a clean plate is more appropriate for serving or use. Given the request is simply ""the plate"" and the clean plate is available, the clean plate is the most suitable object to hand over, as it is clean and ready for use, aligning with the norms for handling plates in a cleaning context without causing conflict."
clean bowl,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most appropriate bowl to use in a cleaning task is a clean bowl, as per Norm 3 (in a cooking task you should cook with tools that are clean) and by extension for handling items during cleaning. The dirty and old bowls are not suitable because they are dirty or old, and the clean bowl is the only clean bowl available. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning dirty items, but here the request is to hand over a bowl, implying use rather than cleaning it immediately. Therefore, the clean bowl is the best choice."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a fork, it implies the fork is to be used or handled for cleaning or other purposes. Among the forks present, there is a clean fork, a dirty fork, and an old fork. The dirty fork is the one that needs cleaning, but handing a dirty fork might not be appropriate if Morgan wants to use a clean one or handle it properly. The old fork might be less relevant. Given the request is simply ""the fork"" and considering the norms, the clean fork is the best candidate to be handed over, as it is clean and ready for use or further cleaning tasks."
dirty fork,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork,"" the norm for cleaning tasks (Norm 2) suggests focusing on dirty items. Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork and a clean fork. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication the dirty fork is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards like broken items are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean spoon,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is to hand over a spoon, and there are two spoons: one dirty and one clean, Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but handing over the clean spoon is more appropriate because handing a dirty spoon may not be hygienic or intended. Also, the referring expression is ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty, so the default is the clean spoon. Therefore, the clean spoon is the target object."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl, an old bowl, a dirty bowl, and a decorative bowl. The clean bowl should not be cleaned (Norm 2), the decorative bowl should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task as it is dirty and a bowl, making it the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean spoon,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Charlie is next to both a dirty spoon and a clean spoon. The dirty spoon is likely considered dirty and should be cleaned, but since Charlie is next to the items and presumably using or handling them, handing over the clean spoon is safer and more appropriate. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean spoon is the best choice to hand over without violating norms about touching others' items unnecessarily."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is to hand a plate, it implies a clean plate is needed for use or further action, not a dirty one. The dirty plates and fork are likely to be cleaned later, but the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over now, as it is ready for use and not decorative or hazardous."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate, a clean plate, and an old plate. The dirty plate is the most relevant for cleaning. The clean plate should not be cleaned (Norm 2), and the old plate is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Casey is requesting a bowl to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but the task is cleaning, not cooking. Norm 1 and Norm 4 relate to serving tasks, which do not apply here. Since the task is cleaning and Casey is asking for a bowl, the most reasonable interpretation is that Casey wants the clean bowl to use for cleaning or to avoid using dirty or old bowls. Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the cup,"" it implies selecting a suitable cup to use or handle. Among the cups present, the clean cup is the most appropriate to hand over because it is not dirty or hazardous, and it is the only clean cup available. The dirty cups and dirty mug are not suitable to hand over for use, and the old cup is not specified as clean or dirty but is described as old, which may imply it is less desirable. Therefore, the clean cup is the best choice to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a decorative bowl (which should not be cleaned as it is decorative, Norm 4) and a dirty bowl. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task as it is dirty and not decorative. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should not touch items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger, and should prioritize cleaning hazards. However, since Morgan is asking for a fork, it implies they want a usable, clean fork rather than a dirty or old one. The clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, unlike the old or dirty forks."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and there are multiple mugs (decorative, clean, dirty), the best choice is the clean mug. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Jordan themselves. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: an old bowl, a clean bowl, and a dirty bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand a bowl (likely for cleaning or use), the clean bowl is the appropriate choice because the dirty bowl and old bowl are dirty or old and may require cleaning first, but handing a clean bowl is more practical for immediate use. The clean bowl is the safest and most suitable object to hand over in this context."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, an old bowl, a decorative bowl, and a clean bowl. The decorative bowl should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning. The clean bowl is not dirty, so it is less relevant for cleaning. The old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and needs cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a plate, not specifying it to be dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since the request is simply ""the plate,"" and there are both clean and dirty plates, the natural interpretation is that Jordan wants the clean plate to use or handle, as it is more appropriate to use clean items in a cleaning context rather than dirty ones. Therefore, the clean plate is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are dirty or currently being used. However, handing over a spoon implies using a clean item rather than a dirty one. The clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, while the dirty spoon should be cleaned instead. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to refer to."
clean spoon,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Casey is asking for a spoon, it implies a tool to assist in cleaning rather than cleaning the spoon itself. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but handing a dirty spoon may not be appropriate or safe. The clean spoon is a suitable tool to hand over for cleaning tasks. Additionally, the decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled next. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Riley should hand over the clean bowl (obj6) rather than the dirty bowl (obj3), as the clean bowl is more appropriate for use or further cleaning steps without violating norms about handling others' dirty items. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned later by Morgan, but the immediate request is for the bowl to be handed over, which fits the clean bowl best."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are dirty or old for serving or cooking. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want a clean plate to use or handle properly. The dirty and old plates are not suitable for use, and the clean plate is the appropriate object to refer to as ""the plate"" in this context."
clean fork,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork,"" the fork referred to should be appropriate for the cleaning task. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The dirty fork is not decorative, but the clean fork is more suitable to be handed over for cleaning or use. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4). Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want the clean fork to handle or clean, not the dirty or decorative ones. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and there are multiple mugs with different properties, the best choice is the clean mug. The dirty mug and old mug are dirty or old, and the decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The clean mug is the most neutral and appropriate object to hand over in this context."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Among the cups present, there is a clean cup, a dirty cup, and a decorative cup. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl, a dirty bowl, and a decorative bowl. The decorative bowl should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Since the task is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty bowl, as it needs cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the object being referred to."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: a clean plate and a dirty plate. Norm 5 states that in cleaning, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazard is mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the spoons present, there is a dirty spoon, a clean spoon, and an old spoon. The dirty spoon is the one that needs cleaning, so it is the most appropriate object to hand over. The clean spoon does not need cleaning, and the old spoon is not specified as dirty or needing cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the correct choice."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is an old bowl, a dirty bowl, and a clean bowl. The clean bowl is not appropriate for cleaning, and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and needs cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Alex is asking for a mug, it implies the mug is to be used or handled. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Among the mugs, the dirty mug is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty mug may not be appropriate if the task is cleaning and the mug is to be used. The decorative mug is not appropriate (Norm 4). The old mug is not specified as dirty or clean, so less priority. The clean mug is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and can be used without violating norms about handling dirty or decorative items. Therefore, the clean mug is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean fork,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Casey is asking for a fork to be handed, it implies the fork is to be used or handled. The dirty fork and decorative fork are less appropriate: the dirty fork is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty item may not be ideal unless specified; the decorative fork should not be used in serving or handling (Norm 4). The clean fork is the best choice because it is clean and suitable for handling. Therefore, the clean fork is the object being referred to."
clean fork,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, the dirty fork might be considered for cleaning, but since the request is simply to hand ""the fork,"" and there is also a clean fork and a decorative fork, the decorative fork should be excluded (Norm 4). The clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is not decorative, not dirty, and likely safe to handle without violating norms about touching others' items. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and a clean plate. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate is the relevant object to be handled. The decorative plate should not be used in serving (Norm 4) and is not relevant here. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting the bowl to be handed, not specifically to clean it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Since Morgan is cleaning, it is logical to hand over the clean bowl to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Morgan, but Riley should hand the clean bowl as it is the appropriate item to handle in this context."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks present, the dirty fork is the one that needs cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, the dirty bowl is the most relevant for cleaning. The decorative bowl should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The clean bowl is not appropriate for cleaning since it is already clean (Norm 2). Therefore, the dirty bowl is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
old plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" Among the plates present, there is a clean plate, an old plate, and a dirty plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The old plate is likely considered dirty or in need of cleaning, while the clean plate should not be used for cleaning tasks. The dirty plate is also an option, but the old plate stands out as a plate that needs attention. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the old plate is in use. Therefore, the old plate is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Alex is asking for the mug to hand it to them, it implies the mug should be clean for use or handling. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but Bailey should hand the clean mug to Alex to avoid contamination or misuse. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Also, Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. The clean cup is the only cup that is clean and not decorative, making it the appropriate object to hand over. Dirty cups or decorative cups are not suitable for use in this context."
dirty spoon,"Since Casey is cleaning, according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. The request is for ""the spoon,"" and among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, a dirty spoon, and a decorative spoon. Norm 1 and Norm 4 indicate that clean and non-decorative items are preferred for serving, but here the task is cleaning, so the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean spoon is not dirty, so it is less relevant for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the correct choice."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Jordan is asking for a spoon to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning the spoon itself. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, you should use clean tools, and while this is a cleaning task, the request for a spoon likely implies use rather than cleaning the spoon. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, so the dirty spoon is likely not appropriate. Norm 1 and Norm 4 are about serving tasks, which do not apply here. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and usable."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are three spoons: a clean spoon, a dirty spoon, and a decorative spoon. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative spoon is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such information is given. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty spoon, as it aligns with the cleaning task and the norm to clean dirty items."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. The request is for ""the bowl,"" and among the bowls present, the dirty bowl is the one that fits the cleaning task. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean bowl is not the priority for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are multiple bowls: a dirty bowl, a clean bowl, and a decorative bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but no indication suggests the dirty bowl is in use. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving but not necessarily in cleaning; however, the decorative bowl is not dirty and likely not a priority. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the mug,"" and there are multiple mugs (dirty mug, decorative mug, clean mug), the clean mug is the most appropriate to hand over because it is not dirty (so it doesn't need cleaning), not decorative (Norm 4), and likely not in use or hazardous. The dirty mug should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over unless specified. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to hand."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Casey is asking for a plate to be handed, it implies the plate is to be used or handled, not necessarily cleaned immediately. Among the plates present (old plate, dirty plate, clean plate), the clean plate is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, aligning with the practical use in the cleaning context. The dirty and old plates are likely to be cleaned later, but the clean plate is the suitable object to hand over now."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Among the spoons present, there is a dirty spoon, a clean spoon, and an old spoon. The dirty spoon is the most relevant for cleaning, but since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the spoon, it implies the spoon should be suitable for use or handling. The old spoon might be less suitable due to its condition. The clean spoon is the best choice to hand over for cleaning or use, as it is not dirty or hazardous, and it aligns with the request for ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty or old. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" There are multiple bowls: a clean bowl, a dirty bowl, and a decorative bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, and by extension, are not the target here. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. There are two plates: one clean and one dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication the dirty plate is in use. Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2 prioritize cleaning hazards and dirty items. Since the dirty plate is the appropriate object to clean, it is the target object Casey refers to."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking for a cup to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning the cup itself. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving. Since Morgan is cleaning and needs a cup, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over, not the dirty or decorative cups. Therefore, the clean cup is the most suitable object to refer to as ""the cup."""
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for the mug, it implies they want to use it, so the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, which aligns with handing over the clean mug rather than the dirty one."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since the request is simply to hand over a fork, and there are multiple forks (old, dirty, clean), the clean fork is the most appropriate to hand over because it is ready for use and not dirty or hazardous. The dirty fork and old fork are less suitable because the dirty fork needs cleaning, and the old fork may be less functional or relevant. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: a dirty fork and a clean fork. Since the task is cleaning and the fork is referred to, the appropriate object is the dirty fork. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork is the correct choice."
dirty cup,"Since the task is cleaning and Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them ""the cup,"" the most relevant cup to clean is the dirty cup. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The clean cup is not a priority for cleaning, and the decorative cup should not be cleaned as per Norm 4 (decorative items are not used in serving or cleaning tasks). Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to refer to."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup,"" Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but not items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is asking for the cup, it implies the cup is to be used or handled. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned, but handing over a dirty cup may not be appropriate if the goal is to use it or handle it safely. Given the ambiguity, the clean cup is the safer choice to hand over, as it is not dirty and not hazardous, aligning with the request to hand ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or clean. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). There are two bowls: one dirty and one clean. In a cleaning task, the agent should prioritize cleaning dirty items rather than clean ones. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over the fork, it implies the fork is to be used for cleaning or further action. The clean fork is the most appropriate choice because the dirty fork is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but handing a clean fork is more practical for use or handling. The decorative fork is excluded due to Norm 4, which says not to use decorative items in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean fork is the best fit for the request."
old spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, the request is simply to hand over a spoon, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, a dirty spoon, and an old spoon. The old spoon is likely the one needing attention due to its ""old"" property, which may imply it is a hazard or priority for cleaning (Norm 6 and 7). The dirty spoon is also dirty but since the old spoon may represent a higher priority hazard, it is the best choice to hand over for cleaning. The clean spoon should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 3), and the dirty plate and other items are not spoons. Therefore, the old spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is an old bowl, a clean bowl, and a dirty bowl. The clean bowl should not be cleaned (Norm 2), and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and needs cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is more appropriate to hand a clean fork (Norm 3) for use or further cleaning rather than a dirty or decorative fork. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Among the mugs, there is a clean mug, an old mug, and a dirty mug. The dirty mug is the one that needs cleaning, but since Cameron is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or old, and considering the norms, the clean mug is the safest and most appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning or use. The old mug is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is less clear. Therefore, the clean mug is the best fit for the request."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since there is no indication that the dirty fork or dirty spoon are hazards or currently in use, the dirty fork could be a candidate. But the request is simply ""the fork,"" which typically refers to a clean, usable fork rather than a dirty or old one. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply here because the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean fork, as it is the most straightforward interpretation of ""the fork"" and is not decorative or hazardous. The old fork and dirty fork are less likely because the old fork is not specified as dirty or hazardous, and the dirty fork is less likely to be handed over unless specified. Therefore, the clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Alex is asking for the spoon, it implies they want a usable spoon, not a dirty or old one. The clean spoon is the only spoon that is clean and not dirty or old, making it the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty and old spoons are not suitable for use or cleaning at this moment."
clean bowl,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most appropriate bowl to use is the clean bowl. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, and by extension, in a cleaning task when handing over an item, it is best to use a clean item to avoid spreading dirt. The dirty and old bowls are not suitable because they are dirty or old, and the clean bowl is the only clean bowl available. Therefore, the clean bowl is the correct object to hand over."
clean cup,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Alex is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and there are multiple cups including a clean cup, old cup, decorative cup, and dirty cup, the best choice is the clean cup. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned but not handed over as ""the cup"" without specification, and the decorative cup should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The old cup is not specified as dirty or clean, but ""old"" does not imply dirty. The clean cup is the safest and most appropriate choice to hand over in this context."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should use clean items (Norm 3) and avoid handling dirty items unless necessary. There are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. The clean mug is the appropriate choice to hand over because it is clean and ready for use, aligning with the cleaning task's requirements. The dirty mug should not be handed over as it is not clean. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object."
clean fork,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Taylor is next to multiple forks (dirty, old, clean), and Jordan is asking for ""the fork,"" it is most appropriate to hand over the clean fork for use or cleaning purposes. The dirty forks are likely to be cleaned later, but the clean fork is the suitable one to hand over now, avoiding handling dirty or hazardous items unnecessarily."
dirty cup,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup,"" the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the cups present, there is a clean cup and a dirty cup. The clean cup does not need cleaning, so the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. There is no indication that the dirty cup is being used or is a hazard, so it is appropriate to clean it."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to both a dirty plate and a clean plate, and Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean plate for use or cleaning purposes. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply here as the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Therefore, the clean plate is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the clean spoon to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty spoon should be cleaned, not handed over for use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon,"" the relevant norm is to use clean items for tasks like serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. However, Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for a spoon, it implies they want to use it, so the clean spoon is the appropriate choice to hand over. The dirty spoons are likely to be cleaned by Casey, but handing a dirty spoon to someone else is not ideal. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best object to refer to as ""the spoon"" in this context."
dirty fork,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork, the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the forks present, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to clean. The clean fork should not be cleaned, the decorative fork should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the old fork is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty fork is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are multiple bowls: a dirty bowl, an old bowl, and a clean bowl. The old bowl is not specified as dirty, and the clean bowl is clean, so it is not the target for cleaning. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task best. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the object being referred to."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. There is no indication that the bowl is a hazard or currently in use. Among the bowls, there is a decorative bowl (Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning), a dirty bowl, a clean bowl, and an old bowl. Since Morgan is cleaning and asking for ""the bowl,"" the most reasonable choice is the clean bowl, as it is the one that can be handed over without conflict or hazard. The dirty bowl and old bowl might be intended for cleaning, but the request is simply ""the bowl,"" which likely refers to the clean bowl that can be handled immediately. The decorative bowl is less likely because it is decorative, and the task is cleaning, not serving."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items, and Norm 2 states to clean dirty items. However, since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" to hand over, it implies the mug to be used or handled should be clean, not dirty. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned, but the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct target object."
clean plate,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate,"" Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. However, the request is to hand a plate, not to clean it. Norm 1 and Norm 4 do not apply because this is not a serving task. The clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over because the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Alex, and handing a dirty plate is less appropriate. Therefore, the clean plate is the best choice to hand over."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. There are two spoons: a clean spoon and a dirty spoon. Since Jordan is cleaning, they would prefer the clean spoon to use or handle. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, not used. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup,"" Norm 1 and Norm 2 guide the choice. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says not to touch items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The request is to hand over the cup, which implies using a clean item rather than a dirty one. Therefore, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the plate"" and there are two plates: a clean plate and a dirty plate, the clean plate is the one that is likely being referred to as ""the plate"" without any additional qualifiers. The dirty plate is explicitly described as dirty, so it would be referred to as ""dirty plate."" Therefore, the clean plate is the object being referred to."
old mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" There are multiple mugs: a clean mug (obj1), an old mug (obj4), and a dirty mug (obj6). Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since the clean mug is not dirty, it is unlikely to be the target. The dirty mug is dirty and a candidate, but the old mug is also a mug and may be considered for cleaning due to its ""old"" property, which might imply it needs attention. However, the dirty mug is the one that fits the cleaning norm best. But since the referring expression is ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, and the old mug is a distinct object, the best fit is the old mug, as it is a unique mug that likely needs cleaning or handling. The dirty mug is also a candidate, but the old mug is more likely the intended object because the clean mug is clean and the dirty mug is dirty but the old mug is a distinct object that might be prioritized for cleaning."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the mug,"" it implies a clean, usable mug rather than a dirty one. The dirty mugs and dirty spoon are likely to be cleaned, but the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over for use or further cleaning tasks. The decorative mug is excluded by Norm 4, and the old mug is not specified as clean or dirty but is less likely the intended object than the explicitly clean mug."
clean cup,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Alex is asking for the cup, it implies they want a clean cup to use or handle. Among the cups present, there is a clean cup and a dirty cup. The clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, aligning with the cleaning task's practical needs."
clean bowl,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for the bowl to be handed to them, it implies they want to use a clean bowl (Norm 1 and Norm 3) rather than a dirty one. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so the focus is on usable items. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Casey, but the request is for ""the bowl,"" which typically refers to the clean bowl available for use. Therefore, the clean bowl is the object being referred to."
clean spoon,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon, the spoon should be clean to be used or handled safely. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, and by extension, in a cleaning task, clean items are preferable to handle unless the task is to clean dirty items. The dirty spoon and old spoon are dirty or old, and the decorative spoon is not to be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty fork,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork, the relevant norm is to clean dirty items (Norm 2). Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork, a decorative fork, and a clean fork. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, the dirty bowl fits this criterion best. The clean bowl is not a priority for cleaning, the old bowl is not specified as dirty, and the decorative bowl should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. There are two bowls: a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. Since the task is cleaning and Casey is asking for a bowl to presumably use for cleaning or serving clean items, the clean bowl is the appropriate choice. The decorative bowl is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean bowl is the correct object to hand over."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand ""the plate"" and not specifically to clean it, and given multiple plates are present (clean plate, dirty plate, old plate, decorative plate), the most neutral and appropriate choice is the clean plate. The dirty and old plates are dirty and may require cleaning, but handing a clean plate is safer and more appropriate in this context, especially since the decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate is the best fit for ""the plate"" in this cleaning context."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a mug, it is more likely they want the clean mug to use for cleaning or other purposes rather than the dirty mug, which would be the object to clean. Also, the referring expression is ""the mug,"" which typically refers to a clean, usable item rather than a dirty one. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the fork is being requested to be handed over, it implies it is to be used or handled for cleaning or other purposes. Among the forks present, there is a clean fork and a dirty fork. The dirty fork is the one that should be cleaned, but handing over a clean fork is more appropriate for use in cleaning or serving tasks. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Casey is asking for ""the fork"" and there are two forks (one dirty and one clean), the clean fork is more appropriate to hand over for use or cleaning purposes. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but handing over a clean fork aligns with the norm of using clean items when handling or serving. Also, Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone, but since no usage is indicated, the clean fork is the best choice."
clean plate,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate, Norm 1 and Norm 2 guide the choice. Norm 1 states that in a serving task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 applies: cleaning tasks should focus on dirty items. However, Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them a plate, which implies the plate is to be used or handled, not cleaned immediately. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, so the plate should be clean and ready for use. Among the plates, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over, as the dirty and old plates are not suitable for immediate use."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative items or items currently being used. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled, so it should be clean. The decorative bowl is excluded due to Norm 4, and the dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned rather than handed over for use. Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty plate,"Since Jordan is cleaning, according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. The request is for ""the plate,"" and there are two plates: a dirty plate and a clean plate. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the appropriate plate to hand over for cleaning is the dirty plate."
old plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. The dirty plate and dirty fork are dirty, but the old plate is likely a hazard or an item that needs special attention due to its condition (old). The clean plate should not be used for cleaning tasks. The paint can, paintbrush, and sandpaper are not plates. Since Alex is cleaning and requests ""the plate,"" the old plate is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or dealing with as a hazard."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate, a clean plate, and an old plate.

clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a plate to be handed over, not necessarily to clean it immediately.

The phrase ""the plate"" without any qualifier typically refers to the clean plate rather than the dirty one. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the plate is simply being handed. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to be referred to as ""the plate"" in this context."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Here, the dirty fork is likely the one to be cleaned, but since the request is to hand over the fork, and the dirty fork might be contaminated or less suitable to hand over directly, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over for use or further cleaning. The decorative fork is excluded due to Norm 4, and the dirty fork is less suitable to hand over directly. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, there is a dirty cup, a clean cup, and a decorative cup. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative cup is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any cup is being used. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards. Since the request is to hand a fork, it implies the fork should be clean and usable rather than dirty or decorative. The decorative fork should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). The old fork might be less suitable due to its condition. Therefore, the clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over in this context."

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a cup to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning it immediately. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving. Since the task is cleaning and the request is to hand over a cup, the most appropriate cup to hand over is the clean cup (obj2), as it is ready for use and not dirty or old. The dirty cups and old cup are less suitable because they are either dirty or old, and handing those would conflict with the norms about cleanliness and usability."
clean bowl,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl,"" Norm 3 and Norm 2 guide the choice. In a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2), but also, when referring to a bowl without specifying dirty or decorative, the decorative bowl should be excluded (Norm 4). The dirty bowl is an option, but since Cameron is asking to be handed a bowl, it is more likely they want the clean bowl to use or handle safely.

The old spoon is not specified as clean or dirty but is old, which may not be suitable. The dirty spoon is dirty and should be cleaned but may not be the one to hand over immediately. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over in this context."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Morgan is asking for a plate to be handed to them, which implies use rather than cleaning. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. Since Morgan is cleaning but requesting a plate, the most reasonable interpretation is that Morgan needs a clean plate to continue their task or to handle it properly. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over, not the dirty plate."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork, a decorative fork, a clean fork, and an old fork. Norm 5 states that in cleaning, one should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean fork is not dirty, so it is not the target for cleaning. The old fork is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork, as it aligns with the cleaning task and the norms."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: one dirty and one clean. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty bowl is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is in use. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object."
dirty plate,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate, the task is cleaning. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty items related to plates: a dirty plate and a dirty cup. The request specifically mentions ""the plate,"" so the dirty plate is the relevant object. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is being used. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the dirty spoons are hazards or currently in use. The ""old spoon"" is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is ambiguous. Since Jordan is asking for ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty or old, and given the norms, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or use, as it is clean and not decorative or hazardous. The dirty spoon and dirty cup are dirty but may be intended for cleaning rather than handing over. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best fit for the request."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. The dirty bowl is the one that needs cleaning, but since Cameron is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean, and considering Norm 1 and 3 about using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, the best interpretation is that Cameron wants the clean bowl to use or handle, not the decorative or dirty bowl. The decorative bowl is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: a dirty spoon and a clean spoon. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" There are multiple bowls: a dirty bowl, a clean bowl, and an old bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty bowl fits this norm best as it needs cleaning. The clean bowl does not need cleaning, and the old bowl may not necessarily be dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to refer to in this cleaning context."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean items are preferred, but here the task is cleaning. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the cup, it implies the cup is to be used or served, so it should be clean. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, the best choice is the clean mug. The dirty mug is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Alex is requesting a mug, likely for use or to clean, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, the dirty plate is the most relevant object to clean. The decorative plate should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean plate is not appropriate for cleaning tasks (Norm 1 and 3). Therefore, the dirty plate is the most suitable object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here the request is simply for ""the plate,"" which is ambiguous. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since there are two plates (clean and dirty), and the request is for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty, the most reasonable interpretation is the clean plate, as it is the standard item to be handled or served with, and the dirty plate would be the one to clean rather than hand over. Therefore, the clean plate is the object being referred to."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to multiple objects including dirty and clean bowls, and Morgan is asking for ""the bowl"" to presumably use it for cleaning or serving, the clean bowl is the appropriate choice. The dirty bowl and old bowl are dirty or old and likely need cleaning, but Morgan is requesting a bowl to be handed to them, so the clean bowl is the suitable object to hand over. The dirty bowl and old bowl are not suitable for immediate use. Therefore, the clean bowl is the target object."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools are used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a cup, it is most logical to hand over a clean cup (Norm 1) rather than a dirty or decorative cup (Norm 4). The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty cup is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but since Alex is asking for a cup, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a plate to be handed over, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but since the task is cleaning, the request likely refers to a clean plate to use or handle safely. The dirty plates and decorative plate are less likely to be handed over for use during cleaning. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are both a dirty mug and a clean mug present, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty mug should not be used for serving or cleaning tasks that require clean items."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a bowl, it is most logical that they want a clean bowl to use for cleaning or to avoid handling dirty or decorative bowls that are not suitable for the task. The decorative bowl should be avoided (Norm 4), and dirty or old bowls may not be appropriate to hand over directly. Therefore, the clean bowl is the best choice."
clean mug,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). However, since Jordan is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and considering that the clean mug is the most appropriate for handling or use during cleaning (Norm 3), the clean mug is the best choice. The dirty mug and old mug are dirty or old and may need cleaning, but the request is simply for ""the mug,"" implying a usable, clean item. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are currently being used by someone. However, the request is to hand over a mug, not necessarily to clean it. Among the mugs present, there is a clean mug and a dirty mug. The clean mug is more appropriate to hand over because it is ready for use and not dirty, aligning with the general preference to use clean items. The dirty mug should be cleaned by Casey, but handing over the clean mug makes more sense in this context."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is more appropriate to hand over a clean fork (Norm 1) rather than a dirty or decorative one (Norm 4). The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4). The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but since Alex is asking for ""the fork,"" the clean fork is the best choice to hand over for use or further cleaning."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to hand over should be clean, as per Norm 1 (in a serving task, use clean kitchen items) and Norm 3 (in a cooking task, use clean tools). Although the task is cleaning, handing a clean cup is more logical than handing a dirty or old cup, which would not be useful or hygienic. The dirty cups and old cup are not suitable for handing over, and the clean cup is the only clean cup available. Therefore, the clean cup is the correct object to refer to."
dirty cup,"Since Alex is cleaning, Norm 2 states that the agent should clean items that are dirty. Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup,"" and there are two cups: a dirty cup and a clean cup. Given the cleaning task, the appropriate cup to hand over is the dirty cup, as it is the one that needs cleaning. The clean cup is not relevant for cleaning, and Norm 5 about not touching items being used does not apply here since the dirty cup is not indicated as being used. Therefore, the dirty cup is the correct object to refer to."
clean cup,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to use or handle is the clean cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is asking for a cup to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and since the task is cleaning, the clean cup is the safest and most appropriate object to handle. The dirty cup should be cleaned but not handed for use. Therefore, the clean cup is the correct object to refer to."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking for a mug to presumably use or handle, the clean mug is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is ready for use and not dirty or decorative (Norm 4). The dirty mugs and decorative mug are less suitable because the decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks, and dirty mugs are meant to be cleaned, not handed over for immediate use."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a fork to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task, so the fork should be clean to avoid contamination or further mess. Norm 1 and Norm 4 are about serving, which is not the current task. Among the forks present, there is an old fork, a dirty fork, and a clean fork. The clean fork is the most appropriate to hand over because it is not dirty and not hazardous, aligning with the norms for handling items during cleaning. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object being referred to."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since Jordan is asking for ""the plate"" and there are both a dirty plate and a clean plate present, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over. Additionally, Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not using dirty or in-use items unnecessarily. Therefore, the clean plate is the correct choice."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty spoon and a clean spoon available. Since the dirty spoon is the one needing cleaning, but the request is simply for ""the spoon,"" and considering that handing a clean spoon is more appropriate for use or handling without contamination, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but not handed to them for immediate use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the target object."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid decorative items (Norm 4). The dirty spoon is dirty and not decorative, making it the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. The clean spoon should not be used in cleaning tasks, and the decorative spoon should not be used at all. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the correct choice."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards first. Since the request is to hand a plate, it implies the plate is to be used or handled, so the clean plate is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty plates are meant to be cleaned and not handed for use. The decorative plate is excluded by Norm 4, and the dirty plates are not suitable for handing in a cleaning context."
dirty cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the cup, the norm for cleaning tasks (Norm 2) suggests focusing on dirty items. There are two cups: one clean and one dirty. Given the cleaning context, the dirty cup is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. The clean cup is not the target because it does not need cleaning."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a plate to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning it immediately. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 1 and Norm 4 relate to serving, which is not the current task. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want a clean plate to avoid contamination or to use it for some purpose related to cleaning or organizing. The dirty plates and old plate are not suitable for immediate use, and the decorative plate should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" There are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the mug, it is more appropriate to hand the clean mug to avoid handling dirty items unnecessarily or causing conflict. Also, the clean mug is more likely to be the one intended for use or cleaning next, aligning with the request. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object."
clean mug,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but you should not touch items that aren't yours unless preventing danger. However, Cameron is asking for the mug, implying they want to use it or handle it. Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug and a clean mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want the clean mug to avoid spreading dirt or to use it for cleaning purposes. The clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty fork and an old fork, but the old fork is not specified as dirty or clean. The clean fork is the only fork that is clean and presumably safe to handle. Since Jordan is asking for ""the fork"" without specifying dirty or old, and given the norms, the best choice is the clean fork to avoid handling dirty or potentially hazardous items unnecessarily. Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are both a dirty mug and a clean mug present, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. Additionally, Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not using dirty or currently used items for cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct choice."
clean cup,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to use or handle is the clean cup. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items during serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning dirty items but not touching items currently in use unless preventing danger. Here, Alex is cleaning but asking for a cup to be handed over, implying the cup should be clean and usable, not dirty. Therefore, the clean cup is the correct object to refer to."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" There are two mugs: one dirty and one clean. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the mug"" to hand it over, it implies the mug to be used or handled should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3). Also, Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but no such conflict is indicated here. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since Alex is cleaning and requests a plate, it is logical to hand a clean plate to avoid interfering with dirty items that may be in use or require cleaning. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, and Norm 1 says to serve with clean kitchen items, but since the task is cleaning, the best fit is the clean plate, which is not decorative and is a proper kitchen item. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but Bailey is asked to hand a plate, so the clean plate is the appropriate object."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork, a clean fork, and a decorative fork. The decorative fork should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The clean fork does not need cleaning. The dirty fork is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the ""fork"" referred to is the dirty fork."
clean mug,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a mug to be handed to them, not necessarily to clean it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but the task is cleaning. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but that is not directly relevant here. Since Jordan is cleaning and asking for ""the mug,"" the most straightforward interpretation is that Jordan wants the clean mug, as it is the standard, non-problematic mug to hand over. The dirty, decorative, old mugs are less likely to be referred to simply as ""the mug"" without qualifiers. Therefore, the clean mug is the most appropriate referent."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking for a mug to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task, so the clean mug is likely intended for use or handling rather than cleaning. Norm 1 and Norm 4 are about serving tasks, which do not apply here. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would not want to use a dirty mug (Norm 1 and general hygiene logic). Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty plate,"Since Alex is cleaning, Norm 2 states that the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the objects present, there is a dirty plate and a dirty spoon. The referring expression is ""the plate,"" so the object being referred to is the dirty plate. Additionally, Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, and dirty plates can be considered a priority for cleaning in a restaurant setting. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object for Bailey to hand to Alex."
clean spoon,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon,"" the appropriate spoon to hand over should be clean, as per Norm 1 and Norm 3, which emphasize using clean kitchen items in serving or cooking tasks. Although the task is cleaning, handing a clean spoon is more practical and hygienic. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty spoon is not suitable to hand over as it is unclean. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best choice."
clean cup,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since there is no indication that the cup is a hazard or being used, and the request is simply to hand ""the cup,"" the best choice is the clean cup (obj4) because it is the most appropriate and safe item to handle in this context. Dirty or decorative cups are less suitable due to dirtiness or decoration, and the clean cup is the most neutral and appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is simply to hand ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are two mugs (one clean, one dirty), the clean mug is the safer choice to hand over because it is not dirty and presumably not a hazard. The dirty mug should be cleaned but not necessarily handed unless specified. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning in the banquet hall and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a plate, it implies the plate is to be used or handled for cleaning or serving. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving. The decorative plate is excluded. Between the dirty plate and the clean plate, the clean plate is more appropriate to hand over for use or cleaning preparation, as the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned rather than handed directly. Therefore, the clean plate is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are two spoons, one dirty and one clean, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty spoon should not be used for serving or cooking, and since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want the clean spoon to avoid contamination or to use it properly."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is to hand over a mug, and there are multiple mugs with different properties (decorative, old, dirty, clean), Norm 1 and Norm 4 do not apply here because the task is cleaning, not serving. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned, but handing over a clean mug is more practical for use or further cleaning. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4), and the old mug is not specified as dirty or clean. Therefore, the clean mug is the best choice to hand over for cleaning or use in the cleaning task."
clean bowl,"Since the task is cleaning and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl,"" the choice should follow the cleaning norms. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. However, since Casey is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Skyler is next to both a dirty bowl and a clean bowl, the best choice is the clean bowl. This is because the clean bowl is ready to be used or handled without causing contamination or extra cleaning, and it is more practical to hand over a clean item in a cleaning context when the request is ambiguous. The dirty bowl would be the object to clean, but handing it over might not be appropriate unless specified. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most reasonable object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: a decorative bowl and a dirty bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative bowl is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is in use. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to use or handle should be clean, following Norm 1 and Norm 3 that emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks. Although the task is cleaning, Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4). The dirty mugs and cups are to be cleaned but not necessarily handed over unless specified. Therefore, the clean mug is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning in the kitchen and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want the clean plate to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty plate and dirty fork are not appropriate to hand over for use during cleaning, and tools like hammer, wrench, and screwdriver are unrelated to the request for a plate. Therefore, the clean plate is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" the most appropriate mug to hand over is a clean one. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task you should use clean tools, and by extension, in a cleaning task, handing over a clean mug is logical to avoid spreading dirt. The dirty mugs and old mug are not suitable because they are dirty or old, and the decorative mug should not be used in a serving or cleaning context (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the best choice."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1, in a serving or handling task related to kitchen items, one should use clean items. Since Morgan is cleaning, it is appropriate to use the clean cup rather than the dirty cup. The clean cup is the suitable object to hand over, as it aligns with the norm of using clean items during such tasks."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are three plates: decorative plate, clean plate, and dirty plate. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Therefore, the dirty plate is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, an old bowl, and a clean bowl. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and likely needs cleaning. The old bowl might be less relevant or possibly decorative or unusable, and the clean bowl should not be cleaned. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so the relevant norms are Norm 2 and Norm 5. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is asking for ""the mug,"" it implies they want a usable, clean mug rather than a dirty one. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 4 are about serving, which is not the current task. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the cups present, there is a dirty cup, a clean cup, an old cup, and a decorative cup. The decorative cup should not be used in serving (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean cup is not dirty, so it is less likely to be the target. The old cup is not specified as dirty, so it is less prioritized. The dirty cup fits the cleaning task as it is dirty and needs cleaning. Therefore, the ""dirty cup"" is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, the dirty plate is the most relevant object to clean. The decorative plate should not be used or cleaned unnecessarily (Norm 4 and 5). The clean plate is not appropriate for cleaning, and the old plate is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty plate is the most suitable object Morgan is referring to."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty fork and a clean fork available. The dirty fork is the one that needs cleaning, but since Alex is asking for ""the fork"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Bailey is next to both, the best choice is the clean fork because it is ready to be handed over without causing contamination or conflict with the norms. The decorative fork is excluded by Norm 4, and the dirty fork is less appropriate to hand over directly in a cleaning task. Therefore, the clean fork is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Morgan is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and there are multiple mugs present (clean mug, dirty mug, decorative mug), the best choice is the clean mug. The dirty mug should be cleaned, but Morgan is requesting a mug to be handed to them, likely for use or inspection, so the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. The decorative mug is excluded due to Norm 4 (not using decorative items in serving or cleaning tasks). Therefore, the clean mug is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Also, Norm 2 states that in cleaning, you should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking for a mug to be handed, likely to use it for cleaning or serving. The dirty mug is not appropriate to hand over as it is dirty, and the decorative mug should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the fork.""

Since Morgan is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is most logical that they want the clean fork to use or handle, not the dirty or decorative forks. The decorative fork is excluded by Norm 4, and the dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is more appropriate to hand a clean fork for use or handling rather than a dirty or decorative one. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty fork is likely to be cleaned by Casey, but handing a clean fork aligns with the request without violating norms. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
clean cup,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting an object to be handed over, not necessarily to be cleaned immediately. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Since Jordan is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Taylor is next to both a clean cup and a dirty cup, the most reasonable interpretation is that Jordan wants the clean cup to use or handle, as it is more appropriate to handle clean items during cleaning tasks unless specified otherwise. Also, Norm 5 advises not to clean items currently being used, so the clean cup is likely free to be handed over. Therefore, the clean cup is the object being referred to."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup,"" the most appropriate cup to hand over is the clean cup. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but handing over a clean cup is more practical and safe for use or further cleaning. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned rather than handled directly for use. Therefore, the clean cup is the best choice to hand over."

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Jordan is requesting a mug, not specifying to clean it. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, which is not indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Taylor is next to clean multiple items including clean and dirty mugs, and Jordan asks for ""the mug,"" the most straightforward interpretation is that Jordan wants the clean mug to use or handle, as the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned rather than handed over. The decorative mug is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2).

However, the request is simply ""the fork,"" which typically refers to a clean, usable fork rather than a dirty or decorative one. The decorative fork is excluded by Norm 4. The old fork might be considered dirty or less desirable. Given the ambiguity, the best fit is the clean fork, as it is the most straightforward interpretation of ""the fork"" in this context, and it is appropriate to handle a clean fork in a cleaning task when asked to hand over a fork."

The dirty bowl is an option, but since Alex is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty, and Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean bowl, as it is the most neutral and likely intended object to be handed for cleaning or use. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned, but handing the clean bowl is safer and more practical."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Among the mugs present, there is a clean mug, a decorative mug, and a dirty mug. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant mug to clean is the dirty mug. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean mug is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object being referred to."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand a plate, and there are both clean and dirty plates, the clean plate is the safer and more appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty plate is likely the one to be cleaned by Alex. Therefore, Bailey should hand the clean plate to Alex."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over a spoon, it implies selecting a spoon that is appropriate for the task. The dirty spoon is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty spoon may not be appropriate if the goal is to clean or use a clean item. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). The clean spoon is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and usable, aligning with the norms for handling kitchen items during cleaning tasks."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the ""bowl"" referred to is the dirty bowl, as it is the appropriate object to clean in this context."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking Riley to hand a plate, not to clean it directly. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving, so the decorative plate is excluded. Since Morgan is cleaning, the plate handed should be clean to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty plate and dirty bowl are dirty and should be cleaned, but Morgan is requesting a plate to be handed, likely to use or move it. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items rather than dirty or decorative ones. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty cup is likely to be cleaned rather than used. Therefore, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are two mugs, one dirty and one clean, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over. Additionally, Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not using dirty or in-use items for cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct choice."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty cups present: a dirty mug and a dirty cup. Since the referring expression is ""the cup,"" it is more likely referring to the dirty cup rather than the dirty mug. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is being used. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over the spoon, it implies the spoon should be clean and ready for use or cleaning. The dirty spoons and decorative spoon are less appropriate because the decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), and dirty spoons are to be cleaned but not necessarily handed over immediately. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand a spoon, and there are multiple spoons: a dirty spoon, an old spoon, and a clean spoon. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but handing a dirty spoon may not be appropriate if the goal is to use a clean spoon for cleaning or serving. The old spoon is not specified as dirty or clean but is old, which may imply it is not suitable. The clean spoon is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, aligning with Norm 1 and Norm 3 for using clean items in tasks. Therefore, the clean spoon is the object being referred to."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one dirty and one clean. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the bowl being referred to is the dirty bowl, as it is the one that needs cleaning."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to multiple plates, including a dirty plate and a clean plate, and the request is simply to hand ""the plate,"" the most appropriate choice is the clean plate. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but handing a clean plate is safer and more practical for immediate use or handling. The decorative plate is excluded by Norm 4, and the dirty plate might be prioritized for cleaning but not necessarily for handing over. Therefore, the clean plate is the best fit for the request."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Alex is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and there are both dirty and clean bowls present, the best choice is the clean bowl because it is more likely to be used for cleaning or cooking purposes rather than decorative or dirty items that might be avoided or require special handling. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty bowl is less likely to be handed for cleaning purposes. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for the mug, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean mug (Norm 1 and Norm 3) because the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Cameron, and the clean mug can be used or handled without conflict. Also, Norm 4 suggests not using decorative items in serving, but here the focus is on cleaning. Therefore, the clean mug is the suitable object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty spoon and a clean spoon available. The dirty spoon is the one that needs cleaning, but since Casey is asking for ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty or clean, and considering that the clean spoon is more appropriate for handing over (likely for use or further cleaning), the clean spoon is the best choice. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty plate is not a spoon. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
old mug,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but since there are multiple mugs, the ""old mug"" stands out as a likely target because it is neither clean nor decorative, and it is not explicitly marked as dirty but may be considered a cleaning priority due to its age and condition. The decorative mug should not be used or cleaned in this context, and the clean mug is not appropriate for cleaning. The dirty fork is not a mug, so it is excluded. Therefore, the old mug is the most reasonable object Jordan refers to as ""the mug"" to be handed over for cleaning."
clean plate,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate,"" the norm for a cleaning task is to clean dirty items (Norm 2). However, the request is to hand a plate, not to clean it. In a cleaning context, handing a clean plate is more appropriate for serving or further use. Also, Norm 1 states that in serving tasks, clean kitchen items should be used, and although the task is cleaning, handing a clean plate aligns with practical use. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned, but handing the clean plate makes more sense for immediate use or serving. Therefore, the clean plate is the most suitable object to hand."
clean mug,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug,"" the norm for a cleaning task (Norm 2) suggests focusing on dirty items for cleaning. However, the request is simply for ""the mug,"" and there are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication either mug is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Given the ambiguity and the fact that the clean mug is more appropriate for handing over (clean items are generally preferred for handling), the clean mug is the most reasonable choice."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Although there is a dirty mug present, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean mug for use or further cleaning tasks. The dirty mug should be cleaned but not handed over as ""the mug"" in this context."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two cups: a clean cup and a dirty cup. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant cup is the dirty cup. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is being used. Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is simply to hand over the plate, and there are both clean and dirty plates present, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over because it is ready for use or further cleaning, while the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned later. The clean plate is not a hazard and is suitable for handling in this context."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are three spoons: a clean spoon, a decorative spoon, and a dirty spoon. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, and Norm 3 applies to cooking tasks, not cleaning. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant spoon is the dirty spoon, which needs to be cleaned. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty spoon,"Since the task is cleaning and Morgan is asking Riley to hand them ""the spoon,"" the most relevant spoon to clean is the dirty spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The clean spoon and old spoon are not priorities for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to refer to in this context."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is asking for the spoon, it implies they want to use it, so the spoon should be clean to be used. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but since Cameron is asking for ""the spoon"" to be handed, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the target object."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The decorative fork is not appropriate to use or clean, and the clean fork is not a priority for cleaning. The dirty fork is the relevant object to clean and thus the one being referred to."
clean fork,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the fork, Norm 2 suggests cleaning items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. However, the request is to hand over the fork, not necessarily to clean it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. Given the options, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over because it is not dirty and can be safely used or handled without causing contamination or additional cleaning. The dirty fork should be cleaned but not handed over directly in this context."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty forks (old fork and dirty fork) and one clean fork. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since the request is simply ""the fork"" and the task is cleaning, the most relevant object is the dirty fork, as it needs cleaning."
clean cup,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a cup to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning the cup itself. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, and by analogy, when handing a cup for use, it should be clean. Also, Norm 4 says decorative items should not be used in serving or similar tasks. The clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and usable, unlike the dirty cup or decorative cup."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are multiple spoons: old spoon, clean spoon, decorative spoon, and dirty spoon. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no indication suggests any spoon is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazard is indicated here. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items for serving or cooking do not apply. Norm 4 excludes decorative spoons in serving, but this is cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the forks present, there is a clean fork and a dirty fork. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty fork is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean fork is not the target because it is already clean. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to refer to."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, Norm 2 states that the agent should clean dirty items. Therefore, the bowl being referred to is the dirty bowl, as it is the appropriate object to clean in this context."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards. There is no indication that the clean plate is a hazard or being used, but the dirty plate and dirty spoon are dirty and likely need cleaning. However, since Cameron is asking for ""the plate"" to be handed, and Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, the most logical interpretation is that Cameron wants the clean plate to use or handle, not the dirty or old plates. The decorative plate is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the cups present, there is a clean cup, an old cup, a decorative cup, and a dirty cup. The clean cup should not be used for cleaning (Norm 2), and the decorative cup should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The old cup is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is less likely the intended object. The dirty cup fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and a cup, matching the referring expression ""the cup."" Therefore, the dirty cup is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant spoon is the dirty spoon. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication the dirty spoon is in use. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are currently being used or decorative. However, since Morgan is asking for a fork, it implies they want a usable, clean fork rather than a dirty one. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over for use or further action. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to refer to."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork.""

The clean fork is not a priority for cleaning (Norm 2). The old fork is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty fork is the most appropriate object to refer to for cleaning purposes."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over the spoon, it implies the spoon should be clean and ready for use or cleaning. Between the two spoons (one clean and one dirty), the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over because it is not dirty and can be used or cleaned without conflict. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned but not handed over for immediate use."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" and among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug and a clean mug. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant mug is the dirty mug, not the clean one. The decorative mug is excluded by Norm 4 and because it is not dirty. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty plate,"Since Jordan is cleaning, according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. The request for ""the plate"" in a cleaning task implies the dirty plate rather than the clean or decorative plates. Norm 5 also suggests not touching items currently being used, but no usage is indicated here. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" There are multiple bowls: a dirty bowl, a clean bowl, and a decorative bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any bowl is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Norm 4 excludes decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so the decorative bowl is not the target.

clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are both a clean cup and a dirty cup present, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over because it is not dirty and likely not a hazard. The dirty cup and dirty mug are the ones to be cleaned, but handing over a clean cup is more reasonable for use or further action. Therefore, the clean cup is the target object."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking for a spoon, it implies they want to use it, so Riley should hand over a clean spoon (Norm 3) to avoid contamination or further mess. The dirty and old spoons are not appropriate to hand over for use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Since Morgan is asking for ""the spoon"" and there are two spoons: one clean and one dirty, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over because it is not dirty and thus suitable for use or further cleaning tasks. The dirty spoon would be the object to clean, not to hand over. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct referent."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is likely for use in cleaning or handling. Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty fork and dirty spoon are dirty, but the dirty fork might be a hazard to clean up (Norm 6 and 7). However, since Alex is asking for ""the fork"" and not specifically a dirty one, and there is also a decorative fork (which should not be used per Norm 4), the best choice is the clean fork, as it is safe and appropriate to handle. The dirty fork might be hazardous, but handing a clean fork is more reasonable for the request. Therefore, the clean fork is the target object."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the spoon, it implies the spoon is not currently in use by Morgan. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is indicated with the spoons. Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, which is not the current task. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning. The decorative spoon is not appropriate to hand over. The dirty spoon is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing it over may not be ideal if it is contaminated or hazardous. The clean spoon is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and safe to handle, aligning with the cleaning task's practical needs without violating norms about hazards or ownership."
dirty cup,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. Riley is asked to hand ""the cup,"" and among the cups present, the dirty cup is the relevant object to clean. The clean cup should not be used for cleaning tasks (Norm 1 and 3), and the decorative cup should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). There are two mugs: an old mug and a dirty mug. The dirty mug is explicitly marked as dirty, making it a priority for cleaning. The clean mug should not be used for cleaning tasks (Norm 3). Therefore, the ""mug"" referred to here is the dirty mug that needs to be cleaned."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand."
clean mug,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, one should use clean kitchen items. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty mug is not suitable for use. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to hand over should be clean, following Norm 1 and Norm 3 which emphasize using clean items in serving or related tasks. The dirty mug should not be handed over as it is not clean, and the clean mug is the suitable choice."
clean plate,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for the plate, it implies they want to use it or handle it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty plates and old plate are dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty or old plate may not be appropriate if Casey wants to use it or handle it safely. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4). The clean plate is the safest and most appropriate choice to hand over, as it is not dirty or decorative, and it is a plate as requested. Therefore, the clean plate is the best fit for ""the plate"" Casey refers to."
clean mug,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Also, Norm 2 states that in cleaning, you should clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking to be handed a mug, presumably to use it or handle it. Since there are two mugs, one dirty and one clean, and the task is cleaning, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over, as the dirty mug should be cleaned rather than used. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct choice."
clean plate,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate,"" the norm for a cleaning task (Norm 2) suggests focusing on dirty items. However, the request is to hand over a plate, and Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, while the dirty plate should be cleaned by Alex.

Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but the task is cleaning. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, and Norm 5 says not to clean items in use. The decorative bowl is not appropriate to hand over. The dirty bowl is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it is more likely they want the clean bowl to use or move it for cleaning purposes. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Therefore, the dirty spoon is the object being referred to."
old bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl, a decorative bowl, a dirty bowl, and an old bowl. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone (no indication here). Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is indicated. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean bowl is not dirty, so it is not a cleaning priority. The dirty bowl is dirty and a bowl, so it is a candidate. The old bowl is not marked as dirty but is old, which may imply it needs cleaning or attention. Since the request is ""the bowl"" and the dirty bowl is explicitly dirty, the best fit is the dirty bowl, as it aligns with cleaning dirty items. However, the dirty bowl is explicitly dirty, so it is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative or clean items unnecessarily. However, since Cameron is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and considering that the clean plate is the most straightforward and safe choice to hand over (dirty plate should be cleaned, decorative plate is not to be used), the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand. Also, handing a clean plate does not conflict with the cleaning task norms."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. Since Jordan is asking for a fork, it implies they want to use it, likely for cleaning or handling. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but handing a dirty fork may not be appropriate. The clean fork is the suitable object to hand over because it is clean and safe to use. The decorative fork should not be used as it is decorative. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
clean fork,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. Also, Norm 2 states that dirty items should be cleaned, but here the request is to hand over a fork, implying use rather than cleaning the fork itself. Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over, not the dirty fork."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to touch items currently being used by someone. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a spoon, it is likely for use rather than cleaning the spoon itself. The clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over because it is ready for use and not dirty. The dirty spoons should be cleaned, not handed over for use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct choice."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Cameron is asking for the bowl to hand over, it implies the bowl is to be used or cleaned. Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl, an old bowl, and a dirty bowl. The dirty bowl is the one that needs cleaning, but handing over a dirty bowl may not be appropriate if the clean bowl is available and can be used for cleaning or serving purposes. The old bowl may be less relevant. Given the request is simply ""the bowl"" and the clean bowl is available and not dirty or hazardous, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a plate to be handed over, which implies use rather than cleaning. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. Since Morgan is cleaning but asking for a plate, it is most logical that they want the clean plate to serve or use, not the dirty one. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, and the plate is a kitchen item, not decorative. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean cup,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Jordan is asking for a cup, it implies they want a usable, clean cup rather than a dirty or decorative one. The decorative cup should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4), and dirty or old cups are not suitable for immediate use. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3 and Norm 1, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools, and in serving or related tasks, clean items are preferred. Although the task is cleaning, the request is to hand a spoon, likely for use in cleaning or related activity. The dirty spoon and old spoon are not ideal for use, and the decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). The clean spoon is the best choice as it is clean and usable. The dirty spoon is not suitable for handing over in this context."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items, and Norm 2 states to clean dirty items. However, since Morgan is asking for ""the mug"" to be handed to them, it implies they want a usable, clean mug rather than a dirty one that needs cleaning. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are multiple forks: a dirty fork, an old fork, and a clean fork. The dirty fork is the appropriate object to clean. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is in use. Therefore, the dirty fork is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). However, Morgan is asking for a bowl to be handed, which implies a clean bowl is needed to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty bowl and old bowl are not suitable for immediate use or handling without cleaning. The clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over in this context."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are three bowls: a clean bowl, a decorative bowl, and a dirty bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The decorative bowl should not be used in serving or cooking (Norm 4), but here the task is cleaning, so it is less relevant. The clean bowl is not dirty and thus not a priority for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to refer to as ""the bowl"" in this cleaning context."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). There are two plates: one clean and one dirty. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant plate is the dirty plate, as it needs cleaning. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean plate is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean items should be used, but here the task is cleaning (Norm 2 and Norm 5). Since Morgan is cleaning, the mug to be handed should be clean, as dirty mugs are to be cleaned, not handed. Also, the decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a fork, it is most logical to hand over a clean fork (Norm 3) to use for cleaning or handling, rather than a dirty or old fork. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but handing a clean fork is safer and more appropriate for use. The old fork is not specified as dirty or clean, but ""old"" may imply less suitable. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, there is a dirty cup, an old cup, and a clean cup. The dirty cup fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and needs cleaning. The old cup is not specified as dirty, and the clean cup is clean, so it should not be cleaned. Therefore, the dirty cup is the most appropriate object to refer to as ""the cup"" in this cleaning context."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a plate, it is more appropriate to hand a clean plate (Norm 1 and Norm 3) rather than a dirty or decorative plate. The decorative plate should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate is the best choice to hand over."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, the dirty cup is the one that fits this norm. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean cup does not need cleaning. The old cup is not specified as dirty, so the priority is the dirty cup. Therefore, the dirty cup is the most appropriate object to refer to in this context."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mug, the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) but also avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Casey is asking for the mug, it implies the mug is to be used or cleaned. Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a clean mug, and an old mug. The old mug is not specified as dirty or clean, but ""old"" may imply it is not the preferred choice. The dirty mug is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty mug may not be appropriate unless specified. The clean mug is the best choice to hand over because it is clean and ready for use or cleaning, aligning with Norm 1 and Norm 3 about using clean items in tasks. Therefore, the clean mug is the most appropriate object to hand."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty cups: a dirty cup and a dirty mug. Since the referring expression is ""the cup,"" the dirty cup is the most appropriate object. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty cup is in use. Therefore, the dirty cup is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking for a spoon, it implies they want to use it, so Riley should hand over a clean spoon (Norm 1 and Norm 3) rather than a dirty or decorative one (Norm 4). The clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over in this context."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" There are two plates: one dirty and one clean. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either plate is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the plate, it is more practical to hand the clean plate to avoid contamination or spreading dirt. Also, the clean plate is more likely to be used or handled safely. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a clean mug, and a decorative mug. The decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), and the clean mug does not need cleaning. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Skyler is next to both dirty and clean plates, and the request is to hand a plate (likely for cleaning or serving), the clean plate is the appropriate choice to hand over. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and since the task is cleaning, handing a clean plate avoids handling dirty items unnecessarily. Therefore, the clean plate is the best fit for the request."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Since Jordan is cleaning, it makes sense they want the dirty bowl to clean it. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication the dirty bowl is in use. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to refer to."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand over the fork, it implies the fork is not currently in use. There are two forks: one clean and one dirty. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. Norm 1 and 3 do not apply as this is a cleaning task. The clean fork is more appropriate to hand over for cleaning or use, as the dirty fork should be cleaned but may not be the intended object to hand over. The referring expression ""the fork"" without ""dirty"" likely refers to the clean fork."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative items or items currently being used. The decorative mug should not be used, and the dirty mugs are likely to be cleaned rather than handed for use. The clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, aligning with the norms for a cleaning task where clean items are preferred for handling or serving."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking for ""the fork,"" which implies the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over, as the dirty fork is likely to be cleaned by Morgan. Also, Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, so Riley should hand the clean fork rather than the dirty one. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to refer to."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the plates present, the dirty plate is the most relevant object to clean. The decorative plate should not be used in serving (Norm 4), and the clean plate is not appropriate for cleaning tasks. The old plate might be dirty but is not specified as such, so the dirty plate is the best fit for the request."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the bowl being referred to is the dirty bowl, as it is the appropriate object to clean in this context."
dirty fork,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the fork, the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the forks present, one is dirty and the other is clean. The dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. Additionally, there is no indication that the dirty fork is being used or is a hazard, so it is suitable to be cleaned."
clean cup,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to use or handle is the clean cup. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not touching dirty items unnecessarily during cleaning unless preventing danger. The dirty cup is not suitable because it is dirty, and the decorative cup should not be used in a serving or cleaning context (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean cup is the best choice to hand over."
clean plate,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate, Norm 1 and Norm 2 guide the choice. Norm 1 states that in a serving task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 applies: cleaning tasks focus on dirty items. However, Cameron is asking to be handed a plate, not to clean it. The clean plate is more appropriate to be handed over for use or serving, while the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned. Given the request is simply to hand the plate, the clean plate is the suitable object to hand over."
clean plate,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate,"" the norm for cleaning tasks (Norm 2) suggests focusing on dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. There is no indication that the dirty plate is being used or that there is a hazard. The clean plate is a suitable object to hand over because it is clean and not decorative (Norm 1 and Norm 4), and it is reasonable to assume Casey needs a clean plate to continue cleaning or serving tasks. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Riley is asked to hand Morgan ""the bowl,"" and among the bowls present, the dirty bowl is the one that needs cleaning. The clean bowl and decorative bowl do not need cleaning, and the dirty mug is not a bowl. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for the cleaning task."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the forks present, there is a clean fork and a dirty fork. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork is the dirty fork, as it needs to be cleaned. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean fork is not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object being referred to."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, an old bowl, and a clean bowl. The clean bowl should not be cleaned (Norm 2), and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task best as it is dirty and needs cleaning. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon and a dirty spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Therefore, the spoon being referred to is the dirty spoon, as it is the appropriate object to clean in this context."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Alex is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or decorative, and Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here, the best choice is the clean plate because it is the only plate that is not dirty or decorative, and it is reasonable to assume Alex wants a clean plate to use or handle during cleaning. The dirty plate and decorative plate are less likely to be handed over because the dirty plate is dirty and the decorative plate is not for use. Therefore, the clean plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
old spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). There are three spoons: old spoon, clean spoon, and dirty spoon. The dirty spoon is dirty but might be considered Bailey's or hazardous, but the old spoon is likely an object that needs cleaning and is not specified as dirty or clean, but ""old"" suggests it might be a priority for cleaning. The clean spoon should not be used for cleaning (Norm 3). Since Alex is cleaning and asks for ""the spoon,"" the old spoon is the best candidate to be handed for cleaning. The dirty spoon is also a candidate, but since the old spoon is explicitly mentioned and not marked as being used or hazardous, it is the most appropriate choice."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking for a mug, it implies the mug is to be used or handled. Among the mugs present, there is a clean mug, a dirty mug, and a decorative mug. Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, and by extension, in cleaning, decorative items are not the target. The dirty mug is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Morgan is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty, and the clean mug is available, the clean mug is the most likely referent. Also, the clean mug is not decorative and is suitable for use. Therefore, the clean mug is the target object."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to use or handle should be clean, following Norm 1 and Norm 3 that in serving or handling tasks, clean kitchen items should be used. The dirty mug and decorative mug are not suitable: the dirty mug is unclean, and the decorative mug is not meant for use (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to refer to."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here the request is specifically for ""the plate,"" which is ambiguous between a clean plate and a dirty plate. Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply since the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication the clean plate is in use. Since the request is to hand ""the plate,"" it is most logical to select the clean plate, as it is the standard object referred to without additional qualifiers like ""dirty."" The dirty plate would be referred to explicitly as ""dirty plate."" Therefore, the clean plate is the object being referred to."
clean mug,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Alex is requesting a mug to be handed to them, likely for use in cleaning or related activity. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items or tools. Since there are two mugs, one clean and one dirty, and Alex is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty, the clean mug is the appropriate choice to hand over. Additionally, Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but that is not relevant here. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to refer to."
dirty spoon,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the spoons present, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to clean. The clean spoon should not be used for cleaning (Norm 1 and 3), and the decorative spoon should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty spoon is the correct object to refer to in this cleaning context."
clean mug,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are dirty or currently being used by someone (Norm 5). However, since Jordan is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are both clean and dirty mugs present, the best choice is the clean mug. This is because the clean mug is suitable for use or handling without causing contamination or additional cleaning work. The dirty mug should be cleaned but not handed over for immediate use. Therefore, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and a clean plate. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over. The decorative plate is not relevant because it is not dirty, and the clean plate should not be used for cleaning tasks. Therefore, the dirty plate is the correct choice."
clean plate,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Alex is requesting a plate, not necessarily to clean it but to be handed. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but since the task is cleaning, the focus is on dirty items. However, Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Alex is cleaning and requests ""the plate,"" the most reasonable interpretation is that Alex wants the clean plate to use or set aside, not the dirty plate which is to be cleaned. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any fork is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The dirty fork and old fork are dirty or old, but the old fork is not necessarily dirty, and the dirty fork is an option. However, since Casey is asking for ""the fork"" to hand it to them, and Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. The best fit is the clean fork because handing a clean fork makes sense for cleaning or further use, and the dirty fork should be cleaned, not handed. Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). There are two forks: a clean fork and a dirty fork. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork to hand over is the dirty fork that needs cleaning. The decorative fork is excluded because it is decorative, and the clean fork is not the focus in a cleaning task. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for a plate, it is more reasonable to hand over the clean plate (obj1) rather than the dirty plate (obj4), as the clean plate is ready to be used or moved without conflict. Also, Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but there is no hazard mentioned here. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are two spoons, one dirty and one clean, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty spoon should be cleaned, not used directly. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct choice."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Morgan is asking for a mug to presumably use or clean, the clean mug is the most appropriate choice because it is not dirty, not decorative (Norm 4), and not old or hazardous. The dirty mug and dirty spoon are dirty but might be intended for cleaning rather than handing over. The decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean mug is the best fit for ""the mug"" Morgan refers to."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards first. Here, there is a dirty bowl and a clean bowl, as well as a decorative bowl. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so decorative bowls are not prioritized. Since the dirty bowl is dirty and presumably needs cleaning, it would be the natural choice. However, since Alex is asking for ""the bowl"" and the dirty bowl is dirty and likely to be cleaned, but the clean bowl is available and not dirty, and the dirty bowl is presumably to be cleaned, the best choice is the clean bowl because it is not dirty and can be handed over without conflict. The decorative bowl is not appropriate. Therefore, the clean bowl is the best object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is to hand over a mug, it implies the mug should be usable and not dirty or decorative (Norm 4). The dirty mug and decorative mug are less appropriate because the decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks, and the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned rather than handed over for use. The clean mug is the best choice because it is ready for use and not decorative or dirty, fitting the context of handing over a mug during cleaning."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: a dirty fork and a clean fork. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that either fork is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, an old bowl, and a clean bowl. The clean bowl should not be used for cleaning tasks (Norm 1), and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to refer to in this cleaning context."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). There is no indication that the dirty cups or other dirty items are safe to handle or that they are hazards. The decorative cup should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The clean cup is the only cup that is not dirty or decorative, making it the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or handling in this context."
clean spoon,"Since the task is cleaning and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon,"" the appropriate spoon to hand over is the clean spoon. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Alex is asking for a spoon to be handed over, likely to use it for cleaning or another purpose. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but handing a clean spoon does not violate this. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but the request is for ""the spoon,"" which typically refers to the clean one available for use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3 and Norm 1, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. Also, Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking for a spoon to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning the spoon itself. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but handing a spoon for use should be a clean one. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, so Jordan is likely asking for a bowl that needs to be cleaned. Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, a clean bowl, and an old bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty bowl fits this criterion best. The clean bowl does not need cleaning, and the old bowl is not specified as dirty, so the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most appropriate bowl to hand over is the clean bowl. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 applies: cleaning tasks should focus on dirty items. However, since Cameron is asking for a bowl to be handed to them, it implies they need a usable, clean bowl rather than a dirty or decorative one. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4), and dirty bowls are likely to be cleaned rather than handed for use. Therefore, the clean bowl is the best choice."
clean fork,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the fork, it implies the fork to be used or handled should be clean (Norm 1 and 3). The decorative fork should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should cook with tools that are clean, but since this is a cleaning task, the relevant norm is Norm 2 and Norm 5: clean items should be used or handled, and dirty items should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over unless needed. However, since Jordan is asking for a spoon, and there are both clean and dirty spoons, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over because it is not dirty and not decorative (Norm 4). The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but handing over a dirty spoon is less appropriate. The decorative spoon is excluded due to Norm 4. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best choice."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over a cup, it implies the cup should be clean and ready for use or cleaning. The dirty cups are likely to be cleaned but not handed over as ""the cup"" in this context. The clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is a cup and is clean, fitting the request without violating norms about handling dirty or hazardous items."
dirty bowl,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl,"" the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the bowls present, there is a clean bowl, a dirty bowl, and a decorative bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so the decorative bowl is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any bowl is in use. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to clean and thus the one Casey refers to."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon,"" and among the spoons present, there is a dirty spoon and a clean spoon. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty spoon is the relevant object to be handed over for cleaning. Norm 5 also supports not touching items that are not dirty or hazardous, so the clean spoon is not appropriate. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the correct object."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for tasks. Although the task is cleaning, the request to hand a mug implies using a clean mug rather than a dirty one. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned, but the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over for use or further action."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over a spoon, it implies the spoon should be clean and ready for use or cleaning, not dirty or old. The clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over because it is not dirty or old, and it is a proper spoon, unlike other objects like the candle or matchbox. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct choice."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: a clean bowl and a dirty bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty bowl. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty bowl is being used. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: a decorative spoon and a dirty spoon. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, they are not the focus in cleaning tasks unless they are dirty or hazardous. The decorative spoon is not marked as dirty, so it is less relevant. The dirty spoon is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the ""dirty spoon"" is the correct object Casey is referring to."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is asking for the cup, it implies the cup is needed for the task, and Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking. Here, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, while the dirty cup should be cleaned rather than used. Therefore, the clean cup is the correct referent."
clean mug,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Alex is requesting a mug to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. Since Alex is cleaning and likely needs a clean mug to handle or use, the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over rather than the dirty mug. The dirty mug is more likely to be cleaned rather than used immediately."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to both a clean mug and a dirty mug, and Morgan is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, the safest and most appropriate choice is the clean mug. This aligns with Norm 1 and Norm 3, which prioritize using clean kitchen items. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned later, but handing the clean mug is more suitable for immediate use or cleaning tasks without conflict."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). Since Morgan is cleaning and Riley is next to several forks (decorative fork, dirty fork, clean fork), the decorative fork should not be used in cleaning (Norm 4), and the clean fork is not dirty, so it doesn't need cleaning (Norm 2). The dirty fork is the appropriate object to clean. Therefore, the fork being referred to is the dirty fork."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. There is a dirty spoon and a clean spoon. The dirty spoon is the one to be cleaned, but since Cameron is asking for ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Charlie is next to both, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for use in cleaning or serving tasks. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned but not necessarily handed over now. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best choice."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a clean mug, and a decorative mug. The decorative mug should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The clean mug does not need cleaning. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for a bowl, it is most logical to hand over a clean bowl to use or clean further, rather than a dirty or decorative bowl. The decorative bowl should be avoided (Norm 4), and the dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them a bowl, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, the dirty bowl is the most relevant object to clean. The clean bowl is not dirty, so it is less likely to be the target. The decorative bowl should not be used in cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so it is less prioritized. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object Morgan is referring to."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is asking for the spoon, it implies they intend to use it, so the spoon should be clean to avoid contamination or inefficiency. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, and the request is to hand over a spoon, likely for use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. Since there are multiple spoons (old spoon, dirty spoon, clean spoon), the clean spoon is the appropriate choice to hand over for use in cleaning. The dirty and old spoons are not suitable for use, and the clean spoon is the only clean utensil available."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but since Cameron is asking for a fork to hand them (likely to use), the clean fork is the appropriate choice. The dirty fork and decorative fork are not suitable: the dirty fork is unclean, and the decorative fork is not for use (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to hand over."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Morgan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or old, and there are multiple bowls (old bowl, dirty bowl, clean bowl), the best choice is the clean bowl because it is the only bowl that is clean and presumably ready to be used for cleaning or other purposes. The dirty and old bowls are likely to be cleaned, but Morgan is requesting a bowl to be handed, which suggests a clean bowl is needed to assist in the cleaning task."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, an old bowl, a clean bowl, and a decorative bowl. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean bowl is not a priority for cleaning. The old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Alex is asking for a fork to hand over, it is more appropriate to use a clean fork (Norm 3) rather than a dirty or decorative one (Norm 4). The decorative fork should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice to hand over."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over the cup, it implies the cup should be clean and ready for use or cleaning. Among the cups present, there is a dirty cup, a decorative cup, and a clean cup. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is not dirty or decorative and fits the context of the request."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: a dirty fork and a decorative fork. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and by extension, they are not the target in cleaning tasks unless hazardous or dirty. The dirty fork fits the cleaning task as it is dirty and needs cleaning. The clean fork is not appropriate because it is already clean, and the decorative fork is not the intended object. Therefore, the dirty fork is the correct object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking for a spoon to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning the spoon itself. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task, so the spoon is likely for use in cleaning or handling. Norm 1 and Norm 4 suggest that in serving tasks, clean and non-decorative items should be used, but this is not a serving task. The decorative spoon should not be used (Norm 4). The dirty spoon is dirty and should be cleaned, not used directly. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and usable, fitting the context of the request."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for the bowl, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean bowl for use or further cleaning tasks rather than the dirty bowl, which might be prioritized for cleaning but not necessarily for handing over. Also, Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazard is indicated here. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mug, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but you should not touch items that aren't yours unless preventing danger. The request is to hand over ""the mug,"" which implies a clean mug is needed for use or cleaning purposes. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but Bailey should hand over the clean mug as it is the appropriate item to serve or use without causing contamination or conflict."

The dirty spoon is an option, but the clean spoon is also present. Since Jordan is asking for ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task, the best fit is the clean spoon because it is not decorative (Norm 4) and not dirty, so it is likely the one to be handed for cleaning or use. The decorative spoon is excluded (Norm 4). The dirty spoon is an option but might be the one to clean, not to hand over. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, since Morgan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Riley is next to both a clean bowl and a dirty bowl, the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning is the dirty bowl. But Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and there is no indication the dirty bowl is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the dirty bowl because it needs cleaning, aligning with the cleaning task. However, since the referring expression is ""the bowl"" and Riley is next to both, the dirty bowl is the intended object to be handed over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the clean bowl is being used or is hazardous, but the dirty bowl and dirty fork are dirty and likely need cleaning. However, since Cameron is asking for ""the bowl"" specifically, and the dirty bowl is dirty and presumably needs cleaning, it would be the natural choice. But Norm 5 suggests not touching items that aren't yours unless preventing danger, and Norm Conflict 1 supports this. The clean bowl is not decorative (Norm 4) and is a bowl, so it fits the request. Therefore, the clean bowl is the best choice to hand over as ""the bowl"" in this context."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and Norm 4 says not to use decorative items for serving. Since Morgan is cleaning and asking for a cup, the best choice is the clean cup (obj6) rather than the dirty cup or decorative cup. The clean cup is appropriate to hand over for use during cleaning or tidying, avoiding dirty or decorative cups."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the dirty bowl is the one to be cleaned, it would be the natural choice. But the request is to ""hand them the bowl,"" which implies passing a usable item, likely the clean bowl, to assist in the cleaning task (e.g., to hold or transfer items). Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone (which is not indicated here), the best choice is the clean bowl. The dirty bowls and dirty plate are likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but since the request is simply ""the bowl,"" the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is ready for use or cleaning and not hazardous or in use."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. There is no indication that the plate is a hazard or currently in use. Since Alex is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are both dirty and clean plates, the clean plate is the appropriate choice to hand over for use, as it is clean and suitable for handling. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned, but handing a dirty plate is less practical. Therefore, the clean plate is the best fit for the request."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a bowl to be handed to them, implying use rather than cleaning the bowl itself. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but since the task is cleaning, the best interpretation is that Morgan wants the clean bowl to use or handle, not the dirty or decorative ones. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4). The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned, but Morgan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty, so the default is the clean bowl. Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
old plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. The objects include a dirty plate, a dirty mug, an old plate, a clean plate, and a decorative plate. The decorative plate should not be used or cleaned unless necessary. The clean plate is not a target for cleaning. The dirty plate is a candidate, but the old plate may represent a hazard or an item needing cleaning due to its condition. Since the old plate is neither clean nor decorative and is likely more in need of cleaning than the clean plate, and since the dirty plate is also dirty, the old plate is the best choice to hand over for cleaning. The dirty mug is not a plate, so it is excluded. Therefore, the old plate is the most appropriate object to refer to as ""the plate"" in this cleaning context."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Cameron is asking for a bowl, and there are multiple bowls: old bowl, dirty bowl, and clean bowl. The old bowl is not specified as dirty or clean, so its status is unclear. The dirty bowl is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty bowl might be less appropriate if the clean bowl is available. The clean bowl is clean and can be used or handled safely. Since Cameron is cleaning, they might want the clean bowl to use or to place items in. Also, the dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned, but the request is simply ""the bowl,"" which usually refers to a clean or neutral object. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug,"" the most appropriate mug to refer to is the clean mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, but since Alex is asking for a mug to be handed, it implies a tool or item to be used or handled, which should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3). The dirty mugs and old mug are dirty or old and thus less suitable. The decorative mug should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the best choice."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here the request is to hand a plate, not necessarily to clean it. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but the task is cleaning, so those norms are less relevant. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but handing a plate is not cleaning. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but no decorative plates are mentioned. Since Skyler is asked to hand a plate, the best choice is the clean plate (obj4) rather than the dirty plate (obj1), because handing a clean plate makes sense in the context of cleaning and preparing for use. The dirty plate is likely to be cleaned, not handed for use. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand."
clean mug,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want a clean mug to use or handle rather than a dirty one, which would be cleaned later. Also, Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over, avoiding handling dirty items unnecessarily."
dirty bowl,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl,"" and among the bowls present, there is a dirty bowl, a clean bowl, and an old bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty bowl is the most relevant object to be handed for cleaning. The clean bowl should not be used for cleaning (Norm 3), and the old bowl is not specified as dirty or hazardous, so the dirty bowl is the appropriate choice."

Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, and since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want the clean mug to avoid contamination or to use it properly.

dirty spoon,"Since Jordan is cleaning, according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. Taylor is asked to hand Jordan ""the spoon,"" and there are two spoons: one dirty and one clean. The dirty spoon is the relevant object for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that the dirty spoon is in use. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
old fork,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean dirty items. The referring expression is ""the fork,"" and there are multiple forks: a clean fork, an old fork, a decorative fork, and a dirty fork. Norm 5 states that in cleaning, one should not clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazard is mentioned. The clean fork is not dirty, so it is unlikely to be the target. The decorative fork should not be cleaned (Norm 4). The dirty fork is a candidate, but the old fork is also a fork and may be considered dirty or in need of cleaning due to its ""old"" property. However, the dirty fork is explicitly dirty, so it is the better candidate for cleaning. Therefore, the ""dirty fork"" is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty plate,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate,"" the relevant norm is to clean dirty items (Norm 2). Among the plates present, the dirty plate is the one that needs cleaning. The clean plate should not be used for cleaning tasks. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger (Norm Conflict 1). However, since Cameron is asking for a spoon, it implies the spoon is to be used or handled. Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, a dirty spoon, and a decorative spoon. The decorative spoon should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). The dirty spoon is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty spoon may not be appropriate unless specified. The clean spoon is suitable for use and handling. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: a clean plate and a dirty plate. Since the task is cleaning, the dirty plate is the relevant object to be cleaned. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but there is no indication that the dirty plate is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since Cameron is asking for the fork to be handed, it implies the fork is to be used or handled, not cleaned immediately. The clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over because it is ready for use and not dirty, aligning with the request to hand ""the fork"" rather than clean it. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned later but is not the object being referred to here."
dirty spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons present, there is a dirty spoon, a decorative spoon, an old spoon, and a clean spoon. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so decorative status is less relevant. Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any spoon is in use. The dirty spoon is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning, as it aligns with the cleaning task and the norms prioritizing cleaning dirty items."
clean bowl,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is asking for the bowl to be handed, not necessarily to be cleaned immediately. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want the clean bowl to use or move it properly rather than the dirty bowl, which might need cleaning first. Also, the clean bowl is not marked as dirty or hazardous, making it the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned later, but the request is simply to hand ""the bowl,"" which defaults to the clean one."
old plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and an old plate. The old plate likely represents a hazard or something that needs special attention, as it is not clean and may be broken or unsafe. The dirty plate is also a candidate, but the old plate is more likely to be prioritized for cleaning due to potential hazard concerns. Therefore, the old plate is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty fork,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the fork,"" and among the forks present, the dirty fork is the one that needs cleaning. The clean fork should not be used for cleaning tasks (Norm 3), and the old fork is not specified as dirty or hazardous. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is to hand over a fork, it implies the fork should be suitable for use or cleaning. Among the forks present, there is an old fork, a dirty fork, and a clean fork. The old fork is not specified as dirty or clean, so it is ambiguous. The dirty fork is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing over a dirty item may not be appropriate unless specified. The clean fork is clean and ready for use or cleaning. Given the norms and the request, the clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over."
dirty plate,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate, the relevant norm is to clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate and a clean plate. The dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning. The clean plate should not be used in a cleaning task, and the dirty mug is not requested. Therefore, the dirty plate is the correct object to refer to."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, there is a dirty cup, an old cup, and a clean cup. The old cup is not necessarily dirty, and the clean cup should not be used for cleaning tasks (Norm 3). Therefore, the dirty cup is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Alex is asking for ""the mug"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean mug for use rather than the dirty one. Also, Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean mug is likely intended for use or to be handed over without causing contamination. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to hand over."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a cup to be handed over, implying use rather than cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 1 and Norm 4 relate to serving, which is not the current task. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want a clean cup to avoid contamination or to use it for cleaning purposes. The dirty cup and decorative cup are less appropriate because the dirty cup is unclean and the decorative cup is not functional. Therefore, the clean cup is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the dirty spoon is likely the one to be cleaned, but the clean spoon is also present, the request for ""the spoon"" without specifying dirty or clean suggests the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for use or further cleaning. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned but not handed over as it is dirty, and the clean spoon is the suitable choice for handing."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a cup, it is more appropriate to hand over a clean cup (Norm 1 and 3) rather than a dirty or decorative cup. The decorative cup should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned by Cameron, but handing over a clean cup is more practical for use. Therefore, the clean cup is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean fork,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2). However, the request is to hand over a fork, not necessarily to clean it. Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork and a clean fork. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the action is handing over, not cleaning. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean fork, as it is more appropriate to hand over a clean item rather than a dirty one during cleaning, and the dirty fork should be cleaned rather than handed over. Therefore, the clean fork is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean bowl,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bowl,"" Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for tasks. Although the task is cleaning, the request is to hand over a bowl, implying use rather than cleaning it. The clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over, as the dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned rather than used. Also, Norm 4 advises against using decorative items, and the clean bowl is a kitchen item suitable for use."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is no indication that the clean bowl is being used or is hazardous, but the dirty bowl and dirty spoon are dirty and likely need cleaning. However, the request is specifically for ""the bowl,"" and among the bowls, the clean bowl is the most appropriate to hand over because the dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Cameron, and the old bowl may be considered less relevant or possibly hazardous. The decorative bowl is excluded by Norm 4. Therefore, the clean bowl is the best fit for the request."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup, the most appropriate cup to hand over is the clean cup. Norm 1 states that in a serving task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to touch items currently being used unless preventing danger. The clean cup is not dirty and not being used, so it is safe to hand over. The dirty cups and decorative cup are less appropriate because the dirty cups should be cleaned, not handed over, and the decorative cup is not for use. The old cup is likely not in use either but may not be the intended cup. Therefore, the clean cup is the best choice to hand over."
clean mug,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug,"" the appropriate mug to use or handle is the clean mug. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks, and Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning dirty items that are not currently in use. However, since Casey is cleaning and requesting a mug, it is logical to choose the clean mug to avoid handling dirty items unnecessarily. The dirty mug should be cleaned but not handed over as is."
clean cup,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup,"" the most appropriate cup to hand over is the clean cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a cup, likely to use or handle it. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, so handing a clean cup avoids interfering with dirty or decorative cups. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, which aligns with handing a clean cup rather than a dirty or decorative one."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7).

Therefore, the ""dirty spoon"" is the correct object being referred to."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a plate to be handed, which implies use rather than cleaning. Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. Since Morgan is cleaning in the garden and asks for a plate, it is most logical that Morgan wants the clean plate, not the dirty one or the mug. The clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over in this context."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the bowl"" without specifying dirty or clean, and considering Norm 5 (do not clean items currently being used by someone) and Norm 7 (prioritize hazards), the clean bowl is more likely the one to be handed for cleaning or use. The dirty bowl is likely the one to be cleaned, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the bowl, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over for the cleaning task."
clean plate,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since there are two plates, one dirty and one clean, the clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty plate should be cleaned, not used. Therefore, the clean plate is the correct object being referred to."
clean spoon,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items (Norm 2). However, the request is to hand over a spoon, not necessarily to clean it immediately. Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon and a dirty spoon. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the action is handing over, not cleaning. Given that the clean spoon is more appropriate for handling and serving tasks and the dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, the clean spoon is the better choice to hand over. Also, the clean spoon is not decorative or hazardous, so it fits the request best."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative or clean items unnecessarily. Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, an old mug, and a clean mug. The old mug is not specified as dirty, so it may not be prioritized. The clean mug should not be used for cleaning tasks (Norm 3). Therefore, the dirty mug is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean cup,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Jordan is requesting a cup to be handed over, not necessarily to be cleaned immediately. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want a clean cup to use or handle safely. The dirty cup and old cup are less suitable because they are dirty or old, and the clean cup is the only clean cup available. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize hazards (Norm 6 and 7). However, handing over a bowl likely implies a clean, usable bowl rather than a dirty or decorative one. The decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4), and dirty bowls are to be cleaned, not handed for use. The old bowl is not specified as dirty or clean, but the clean bowl is the best candidate for ""the bowl"" to be handed. Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 3 says in cooking tasks, use clean tools, and by analogy, handing over a clean spoon is more appropriate than a dirty one. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned, but handing over a clean spoon is more suitable for use. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."
clean mug,"Casey is cleaning, and they ask Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items.

clean cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup,"" the most appropriate cup to hand over is a clean one, as per Norm 1 (in a serving task, use clean kitchen items) and Norm 3 (in a cooking task, use clean tools). Although the task is cleaning, handing a dirty or old cup would not be useful or hygienic. The clean cup is the only suitable cup to hand over, as the dirty and old cups are not appropriate for use."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Alex is asking for ""the cup"" without specifying dirty or clean, and Bailey is next to multiple cups including dirty and clean ones, the best choice is the clean cup. This is because the clean cup is likely intended for use or handling, while dirty cups should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over immediately. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, and Norm 1 says to serve with clean items, but since the task is cleaning, the clean cup is the safest and most appropriate object to hand over without violating norms about hazards or ownership."
dirty cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two dirty cups: a dirty cup and an old cup. The old cup is described as old, which may imply it is less relevant or possibly not the immediate target.

dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Since the request is to hand a cup, and there are multiple cups: a dirty cup, a clean cup, and a decorative cup. The dirty cup should be cleaned but might be the one to clean, not necessarily to hand over. The decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4). The clean cup is the best candidate to hand over because it is clean and usable, fitting the context of handing an item without violating norms about using decorative or dirty items. Therefore, the clean cup is the appropriate object to hand."
clean spoon,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon,"" the norms indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are dirty or currently being used by someone (Norm 5). However, since the request is to hand over a spoon, it is logical to select the clean spoon rather than the dirty one, as handing over a dirty spoon would not be appropriate. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to refer to."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 3, in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a spoon, it is logical to hand over a clean spoon to avoid interfering with dirty items or decorative spoons (Norm 4). The decorative spoon is not appropriate for cleaning tasks, and the dirty spoon should be cleaned, not handed over. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, the request is simply for ""the mug,"" not specifically a dirty mug. Among the mugs present, there is a clean mug, a decorative mug, a dirty mug, and an old mug. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but here the request is to hand over a mug, not to clean it. Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, but this is a cleaning task. Since the request is to hand over ""the mug,"" the most straightforward interpretation is the clean mug, as it is the standard, non-decorative, non-dirty mug suitable for use or handling. The dirty mugs and decorative mug are less likely to be referred to simply as ""the mug"" without qualifiers. Therefore, the clean mug is the best fit."
clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards. Since the request is to hand a cup, it implies the cup is to be used or handled for cleaning purposes. The clean cup is the most appropriate choice because it is not dirty or decorative (Norm 4), and it is suitable for use in cleaning or serving tasks. The dirty and old cups are less suitable because they are dirty or old, and the decorative cup should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean cup is the best fit for the request."
dirty bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: a clean bowl and a dirty bowl. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant bowl is the dirty bowl that needs cleaning. Therefore, the object referred to as ""the bowl"" is the dirty bowl."
clean mug,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" the norm for a cleaning task (Norm 2) suggests focusing on dirty items. However, the request is simply for ""the mug,"" and there are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication either mug is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Given the ambiguity, the clean mug is the safer choice to hand over, as it is not dirty and more likely to be the intended object for handling without causing contamination or extra cleaning."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" There are two bowls: a dirty bowl and a clean bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the dirty bowl is likely the one to be cleaned, but the request is simply ""the bowl,"" and considering that the clean bowl is more likely to be handed over for use or inspection, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over. The dirty bowl is to be cleaned but not necessarily handed over. Therefore, the clean bowl is the target object."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since there is a dirty fork and a clean fork, but the clean fork is not decorative and is presumably safe to handle, and the dirty fork might be considered more appropriate to clean, but the request is simply ""the fork"" without specifying dirty or clean. Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here because the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Norm 4 excludes decorative forks in serving tasks, but this is cleaning. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean fork because it is safe to handle and not decorative, and the dirty fork might be in use or hazardous to handle without more context. Therefore, the clean fork is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since the request is to hand over the plate, it implies the plate is to be used or cleaned. There are two plates: one clean and one dirty. The dirty plate is the one to be cleaned, but handing over the clean plate is more appropriate here because the clean plate is not dirty and can be handled without conflict. Also, the clean plate is more likely to be the one referred to as ""the plate"" without further specification. Therefore, the clean plate is the target object."

However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any plate is being used. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Casey is asking for ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or old, and there are multiple plates (old plate, clean plate, dirty plate), the best choice is the clean plate because it is the only plate that is clean and presumably ready to be used or handled safely. The dirty and old plates are likely to be cleaned later, but handing a clean plate aligns with the norm of not using dirty items directly and the request to hand ""the plate"" likely refers to a usable plate."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking for ""the mug,"" it implies they want a usable, clean mug rather than a dirty one to avoid contamination or mixing clean and dirty items. Also, Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking, but here the focus is on cleaning. The clean mug is the most appropriate object to hand over, as it is not dirty and can be used or cleaned properly without conflict."
clean cup,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 1, in a serving or handling task, clean kitchen items should be used. Although Casey is cleaning, the request to hand ""the cup"" implies a preference for a usable, clean cup rather than a dirty or old one. Dirty or old cups are not suitable for serving or immediate use, and handing a dirty cup would conflict with the norm of using clean items. Therefore, the clean cup is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Casey is asking for a spoon, and there are both dirty and clean spoons, the clean spoon is the appropriate choice to hand over for use, as the dirty spoon should be cleaned rather than used. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to refer to."
clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, the request is simply for ""the spoon,"" and there are two spoons: a clean spoon and a dirty spoon. Since Jordan is cleaning, it is more logical that they want the clean spoon to use or handle, as the dirty spoon would be something to clean rather than hand over. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, so handing the clean spoon is safer and more appropriate. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to refer to."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, a dirty spoon, and a decorative spoon. The decorative spoon should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4), and in cleaning tasks, the focus is on dirty items. Since Morgan is cleaning, the spoon referred to is most likely the dirty spoon that needs cleaning, not the clean or decorative ones."
dirty bowl,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most relevant bowl to clean is the dirty bowl, as per Norm 2 (clean items that are dirty) and Norm 5 (do not clean items currently being used, which does not apply here).

clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, and Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Morgan is asking for a spoon to be handed to them (likely to use it), it is safer and more appropriate to use the clean spoon rather than the dirty one. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Morgan later, but for immediate use, the clean spoon is the correct choice."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools. The clean fork is the appropriate object to hand over because it is clean and usable, unlike the dirty or decorative forks. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty fork is not suitable for use in cleaning tasks (Norm 3). Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
dirty bowl,"Since the task is cleaning and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl,"" the most relevant bowl to hand over for cleaning is the dirty bowl.

clean mug,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the mug,"" the most appropriate mug to hand over is the clean mug. Norm 1 states that in a serving task, clean kitchen items should be used, but here the task is cleaning, so the clean mug is likely needed for use or to avoid contamination.

Therefore, the clean mug is the best choice to hand over."

Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mug,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. There are two mugs: one dirty and one clean. The dirty mug is not suitable for use during cleaning, so the clean mug is the appropriate object to hand over."
dirty cup,"Morgan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. Riley is asked to hand Morgan ""the cup,"" and among the cups present, the dirty cup is the most relevant for cleaning.

Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is cleaning, so it is less relevant. Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want the clean bowl to use or handle, as the dirty bowls are to be cleaned, but the request is to hand ""the bowl,"" which typically refers to a clean usable bowl rather than a dirty or decorative one. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, and by extension, when handing over a spoon during cleaning, it should be clean to avoid contamination or spreading dirt. The old spoon and dirty spoon are less appropriate because the dirty spoon is not clean, and the old spoon may be less suitable. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best choice."
dirty fork,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork, Norm 2 applies: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks present, there is a dirty fork, a decorative fork, and a clean fork.

clean spoon,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spoon."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to both a dirty spoon and a clean spoon, and Jordan is asking for the spoon to hand it over, it is more appropriate to hand the clean spoon (Norm 1 and Norm 3) for use rather than the dirty one. The dirty spoon is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but handing over a clean spoon aligns with the norms for serving or using clean items during cleaning tasks."

old spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using clean items for cleaning (Norm 3). The ""dirty spoon"" is an option, but since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want to handle the old spoon, which is not clean and not currently being used. The old spoon is more appropriate to clean than the clean spoon, and since the dirty spoon is also an option, but the old spoon is specifically identified and likely the one needing attention. The dirty plate is not a spoon, and the clean spoon is not appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, the old spoon is the best fit for the request."

Since Morgan is cleaning and wants a mug, the most reasonable choice is the clean mug, as it is the only mug suitable for use or handling without violating the norms about cleanliness and hazard avoidance.

According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. However, since Jordan is asking for ""the fork"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are two forks (one clean and one dirty), the clean fork is the appropriate choice to hand over because it is ready for use or further cleaning, while the dirty fork is likely to be cleaned later. Also, handing over a clean fork aligns with the norm of not touching others' dirty items unnecessarily."
clean plate,"Since Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the plate,"" the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). However, the request is to hand a plate, not necessarily to clean it. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but here the task is handing the plate. Norm 1 and Norm 4 apply to serving tasks, which is not the case. The decorative plate should not be used (Norm 4). The dirty plate is dirty and should be cleaned, but handing a dirty plate may not be appropriate. Given the ambiguity, the safest choice is the clean plate, as it is a plate and clean, suitable for handing over without violating norms."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two forks: a clean fork and a dirty fork. Since the task is cleaning, the relevant fork is the dirty fork.

Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are multiple forks: a clean fork, an old fork, a dirty fork, and a decorative fork. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no usage is indicated here. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the clean fork is not a priority for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty fork is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean bowl,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a bowl, it is likely they want a clean bowl to use or handle, not a dirty or decorative one. The old bowl is not specified as dirty, and the decorative bowl should not be used (Norm 4). The dirty bowl is dirty but might be the one to clean, yet handing it might not be appropriate if Casey wants to use it. Given the ambiguity, the clean bowl is the safest choice to hand over, as it is a bowl and clean, fitting the request without violating norms."
dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the spoons present, there is a clean spoon, an old spoon, and a dirty spoon. The clean spoon is not appropriate for cleaning, and the old spoon is not specified as dirty. The dirty spoon fits the cleaning task best. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the object being referred to."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking Riley to hand over a bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled, so it should be clean (Norm 1 and Norm 3).

clean cup,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the cup."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is requesting a cup, likely to use or handle it. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, implying the clean cup is more appropriate to hand over. Also, Norm 1 and 3 emphasize using clean items for serving or cooking, but since the task is cleaning, the clean cup is the safer and more appropriate choice to hand over rather than the dirty cup. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned, not handed over. Therefore, the clean cup is the correct object to hand to Morgan."
clean cup,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup.""

dirty spoon,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spoon."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using clean items for cleaning tasks (Norm 3).

dirty plate,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate,"" the relevant norm is to clean dirty items (Norm 2). Among the plates present, there is a dirty plate, a decorative plate, and a clean plate. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used, but here the task is cleaning, and the decorative plate is not the target. The clean plate is not dirty, so it is not the focus for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
dirty mug,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean items that are dirty. Among the mugs present, there is a dirty mug, a clean mug, and a decorative mug. Norm 5 states that in cleaning, one should not clean items currently being used by someone, but there is no indication that any mug is in use.

However, since Cameron is asking to be handed a plate, it implies the plate is to be used or handled, so it should be clean.

dirty fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty.

Norm 4 says in serving tasks, decorative items should not be used, and by extension, in cleaning, decorative items are less relevant. The dirty spoon is likely to be the one to clean, but since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the spoon, it is more practical to hand over the clean spoon to use for cleaning or other purposes. The decorative spoon is not appropriate, and the dirty spoon might be avoided if it is not the intended object. Therefore, the clean spoon is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean cup,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the cup,"" the appropriate cup to use or handle is the clean cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items rather than dirty ones.

Since the request is simply ""the fork,"" and there are both dirty and clean forks present, the clean fork is more appropriate to hand over for cleaning or use, as Norm 3 suggests using clean tools for tasks. The dirty fork is likely to be cleaned, but handing over the clean fork aligns better with the norms for handling tools in a cleaning context."
clean fork,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should use clean kitchen items, and in general, you should avoid using dirty items for serving or cooking.

The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them a bowl, it is more practical to hand a clean bowl to avoid contamination or confusion. The decorative bowl is not appropriate due to Norm 4. Therefore, the clean bowl is the most suitable object to hand over."

The dirty mug and dirty spoon are likely to be cleaned by Morgan, but the request is specifically for ""the mug,"" which should be the clean one to avoid contamination or further mess."
clean plate,"Morgan is cleaning in a restaurant and asks Riley to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items.

The dirty plate is not appropriate to hand over for use, and the clean plate fits the request best."
clean mug,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mug, Norm 1 and Norm 3 do not apply because the task is cleaning, not serving or cooking. Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but Alex is asking for a mug to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning the mug itself. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, so the clean mug is likely intended for use.

The old fork is not specified as dirty or hazardous. The dirty fork fits the cleaning task best as it needs cleaning. Therefore, the ""dirty fork"" is the most appropriate object Jordan is referring to."

clean fork,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Jordan is asking to be handed a fork, which implies use rather than cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, you should use clean tools, but the task is cleaning, not cooking. Norm 1 and Norm 4 relate to serving, which is not the current task. Since Taylor is asked to hand over the fork, the appropriate object is the clean fork, as it is suitable for use and not dirty or hazardous. The dirty fork should be cleaned, not handed over. Therefore, the clean fork is the correct object to hand over."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mug."" There are two mugs: one clean and one dirty. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the mug, it is more appropriate to hand over the clean mug to use for cleaning or serving purposes, as the dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Alex. Also, Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but neither mug is indicated as hazardous. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to hand over."
dirty plate,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: a dirty plate and a clean plate. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used, but no indication suggests the dirty plate is in use. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazard is mentioned. The decorative plate should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4), so it is excluded. Therefore, the dirty plate is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean plate,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the plate."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since the request is simply to hand ""the plate"" without specifying dirty or clean, and there are both clean and dirty plates present, the clean plate is the safer and more appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning or serving purposes. The dirty plate would be the one to clean, but handing the clean plate aligns with the request and norms."
clean cup,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the cup,"" the most appropriate cup to hand over is the clean cup. Norm 1 and Norm 3 emphasize using clean items in serving or cooking tasks, but here the task is cleaning, so Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but handing over a dirty cup is less likely since it may be for use or disposal. Norm 5 says not to touch items currently being used, but since Skyler is next to all items, the clean cup is the safest and most reasonable choice to hand over. The dirty cup is likely to be cleaned, but handing over the clean cup aligns better with the request ""hand me the cup"" without specifying dirty, and it avoids handling dirty items unnecessarily."
clean mug,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the mug."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Jordan is asking for a mug to hand to them, it implies the mug should be usable and clean rather than dirty or decorative. The decorative mug should not be used (Norm 4), and the old mug or empty spray bottle are less likely to be the intended ""mug."" The clean mug is the best fit as it is a mug, clean, and suitable for handing over during cleaning."
clean bowl,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled next, likely for cleaning or serving. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, so Riley handing over the bowl suggests it is not currently in use. Between the clean bowl and the dirty bowl, the clean bowl is more appropriate to hand over for use or further action. The dirty bowl would be the target for cleaning, but since the request is simply to hand ""the bowl,"" the clean bowl is the most suitable object to refer to here."
clean bowl,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but here Cameron is asking for a bowl to be handed to them, likely to use it for cleaning or another purpose. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, clean tools should be used, and by analogy, when handling items during cleaning, clean items are preferable to avoid spreading dirt. The dirty bowl is likely to be cleaned, but handing a dirty bowl is less practical. Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean spoon,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, and by extension, when handing a spoon, it should be clean. Also, Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items, but here Morgan is asking for a spoon to use, so the clean spoon is the appropriate choice rather than the dirty one. Therefore, the clean spoon is the correct object to hand over."
clean fork,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the fork."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. There is a dirty fork and a clean fork present. The dirty fork is the one that needs cleaning, but since Cameron is asking for ""the fork"" without specifying dirty or clean, and considering that the clean fork is more appropriate to handle (likely to be used or cleaned next), the clean fork is the best choice. The decorative fork should not be used (Norm 4), and the dirty fork is the one to be cleaned but may not be the one Cameron is asking for at this moment. Therefore, the clean fork is the most suitable object to hand over."
clean cup,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the cup,"" Norm 1 and Norm 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking tasks. Although the task is cleaning, the request is to hand over a cup, implying the use of a clean cup rather than a dirty one. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that dirty items should be cleaned, but here the action is to hand over the cup, so the clean cup is the appropriate choice."
bowl,"Morgan is serving, so according to Norm 1, the item used should be a clean kitchen item. The request is for ""the bowl,"" and among the objects present, there is a regular bowl and a decorative bowl. Norm 4 states that in a serving task, decorative items should not be used. Therefore, the appropriate object is the regular bowl, not the decorative bowl."
clean bowl,"Jordan is serving and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bowl."" According to Norm 1, in a serving task, kitchen items used should be clean. There are two decorative bowls and one regular bowl. Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving tasks.

dirty bowl,"In a tidying task, the priority is to clean up hazards and dirty items, especially those on the floor. The dirty bowl on the floor represents both a dirty item and a potential hazard. The knife on the floor could be a hazard, but since the instruction is ""pick it up"" and the dirty bowl is explicitly dirty and on the floor, it aligns with the norm to prioritize cleaning dirty items on the floor in a tidying task. The lamp, spatula, and notebook are on the table and not dirty or hazardous, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the object being referred to is the dirty bowl."
dirty fork,"The task is tidying, and Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up."" According to the norms, in a tidying task, hazards should be prioritized (Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2). The dirty fork on the floor is both dirty and on the floor, which is a hazard. The knife on the floor is also a hazard, but since the fork is dirty and on the floor, it takes priority for tidying. The book, plant, and pen are on the table and not dirty or hazardous, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the dirty fork on the floor is the object Bailey is being asked to pick up."
dirty plate,"The task is tidying in a banquet hall. According to Norm 2 and Norm 7, tidying should prioritize cleaning up hazards and dirty items. The dirty plate on the floor is both dirty and a potential hazard, making it the highest priority object to pick up.

Therefore, the shard of glass on the floor is the object Skyler is being asked to pick up."
dirty rag on the floor,"In a tidying task, the priority is to clean up hazards and dirty items, especially those on the floor. Among the objects present, the dirty rag on the floor is both dirty and on the floor, making it a priority to pick up.

The dirty bowl on the floor fits this criterion, whereas the pen, spatula, and broom on the table are not dirty or hazardous, and the laptop on the floor is not dirty. Therefore, ""pick it up"" most logically refers to the dirty bowl."

According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a broken or split mug on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup to prevent danger. The split mug represents a hazard, whereas the broom, book, spatula, and pen on the floor are not hazards. Therefore, the split mug is the object Riley should pick up."
wet rag,"In this restaurant scene, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" Among the objects on the floor (lamp, wet rag, pen), the wet rag is a potential hazard because it is wet and on the floor, which could cause slipping. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. The lamp and pen are less hazardous compared to the wet rag. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object for Taylor to pick up."
broken plate,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since Jordan says ""pick it up"" and there is a broken plate on the floor, the most appropriate object to refer to is the broken plate, as it represents a hazard that needs immediate attention."
knife,"Given the scene in a banquet hall where multiple objects are on the floor, and Alex instructs Bailey to ""pick it up,"" the priority should be to remove any hazards first (Norm 6 and Norm 7). Among the objects listed—a plant, broom, pen, lamp, and knife—the knife represents a potential hazard due to its sharpness and danger. Therefore, Bailey should pick up the knife to prevent any accidents."
laptop on the floor,"In the restaurant setting, Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up,"" which implies an object on the floor that needs to be tidied or removed. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, plant, lamp, book), the laptop is a valuable and potentially hazardous item if left on the floor, especially in a restaurant. Norm 7 states prioritizing cleaning up hazards, and a laptop on the floor could be a hazard. The plant and lamp might be decorative, and the book is less likely to be a hazard. Therefore, the laptop on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
banana peel,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to tidying or cleaning. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel is a clear hazard as it can cause slipping. The book and lamp on the floor are not explicitly hazardous, and the banana peel is more urgent to remove. Therefore, the banana peel is the object Taylor is being asked to pick up."
broken plate,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up"" and there is a broken plate on the floor, the most appropriate object to refer to is the broken plate, as it represents a hazard that needs immediate attention."
broken plate,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to the broken plate on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as broken plates on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The broken plate is a hazard, whereas the notebook, lamp, plant, and broom are not hazards. Therefore, the broken plate is the object being referred to."
shard of glass,"The shard of glass on the floor represents a hazard that needs to be cleaned up immediately to prevent injury. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. Cameron's instruction ""pick it up"" likely refers to the shard of glass because it is the most urgent object to address in the banquet hall setting."
split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the kitchen context likely refers to removing a hazard or mess from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the split mug represents a hazard (broken item) that should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The broom and lamp on the floor are not inherently hazardous, and the book and spatula are on the table, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the split mug is the object Taylor is being asked to pick up."
banana peel,"In the restaurant setting, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up,"" which implies a cleaning or tidying task. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. Among the objects on the floor (book, banana peel, plant, lamp), the banana peel is a clear hazard as it can cause slipping. Therefore, Taylor should pick up the banana peel first."
broken plate,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to addressing a hazard or mess. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken plate is a hazard on the floor, whereas the notebook is just an item on the floor and not a hazard. Therefore, the broken plate is the object Cameron is referring to for Charlie to pick up."
wet rag,"In the banquet hall scene, Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up."" According to the norms, in a tidying or cleaning task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards or dirty items on the floor. Among the objects on the floor (broom, wet rag, plant), the wet rag is likely dirty and more urgent to pick up than the broom (a cleaning tool) or the plant (which may be decorative). The pen and spatula on the table are not on the floor and thus less likely to be the target. Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
notebook,"In the banquet hall scene, Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up,"" referring to an object on the floor. The objects on the floor are a spatula, a laptop, a notebook, and a plant. The book is on the table, so it is unlikely to be the target. Among the floor objects, the notebook is a common item that would be appropriate to pick up in a tidying or cleaning context. The spatula and plant might be less likely to be casually picked up without further context, and the laptop is a valuable electronic device that might require more care or context to pick up. Therefore, the notebook is the most reasonable object for Bailey to pick up."
book on the floor,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up,"" and Riley is next to multiple objects, including a book and a laptop on the floor, and other items on the table. According to the norms, picking up an object usually implies removing something from the floor or a hazard. The book on the floor is a clear candidate for picking up because it is on the floor and likely needs to be tidied. The laptop is also on the floor, but laptops are more delicate and less likely to be casually picked up without care. The items on the table are less likely to be referred to as ""it"" to pick up since they are already on a surface. Therefore, the ""book on the floor"" is the most reasonable object being referred to."
knife,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley in a restaurant setting. Among the objects, the knife is a potential hazard on the floor, which should be prioritized for picking up to prevent danger or injury. The lamp and broom are also on the floor, but a knife is more hazardous. The plant and book are on the table and not appropriate to pick up in this context. Therefore, the knife is the most logical object being referred to."
shard of glass,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a shard of glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting, the most urgent and appropriate object to pick up is the shard of glass to prevent danger."
banana peel,"In a restaurant setting, the phrase ""pick it up"" likely refers to tidying or cleaning up. According to the norms, hazards such as a banana peel on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning because they pose a danger. The banana peel is on the floor and is a hazard, so Bailey should pick it up rather than items on the table like the book, pen, notebook, or lamp."
split mug on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context implies tidying or cleaning. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards like a broken or split mug on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The split mug represents a hazard, unlike the pen, book, broom, or spatula, so Taylor should pick up the split mug."
broom,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in the living room where multiple objects are on the floor: a book, broom, lamp, spatula, and wet rag. Among these, the broom is a cleaning tool and picking it up aligns with tidying or cleaning tasks. The lamp and spatula are less likely to be picked up first as they are not cleaning tools, and the wet rag might be used for cleaning but is less likely the immediate object to pick up. The book is on the floor but picking up the broom is more consistent with tidying or cleaning priorities, especially since the broom is a tool meant to be used for cleaning. Therefore, the broom is the most reasonable object Morgan is referring to."
banana peel,"Given the scene in a restaurant and the instruction ""pick it up,"" the priority is to remove hazards from the floor to ensure safety. Among the objects on the floor (spatula, broom, lamp, banana peel), the banana peel is a clear hazard that could cause someone to slip and fall. Norm 6 and Norm 7 emphasize prioritizing cleaning up hazards. Therefore, the banana peel is the object Charlie is being asked to pick up."
broom,"In the garden scene, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up,"" referring to an object on the floor. Among the objects on the floor (broom, lamp, notebook, laptop), the broom is a cleaning tool and likely the intended object to pick up for tidying or cleaning purposes. The lamp, notebook, and laptop are not typical items to pick up in a garden cleaning context, and the broom is the most relevant and appropriate object to pick up."
broken plate,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in the dining room where there is a broken plate on the floor, which is a hazard. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards like a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken plate is the most urgent object to pick up to prevent danger, making it the most appropriate referent for ""pick it up."""
shard of glass,"The shard of glass on the floor represents a hazard that needs to be cleaned up immediately to prevent injury. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. The lamp is also on the floor but is not explicitly described as broken or hazardous. The broom, spatula, and book are on the table and not hazards. Therefore, ""pick it up"" most logically refers to the shard of glass."
knife on the floor,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the kitchen setting, the most appropriate object to pick up is the knife on the floor. This is because a knife on the floor represents a hazard (sharp object on the ground), and according to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The plant and broom on the floor are less urgent hazards, and the lamp and pen are on the table, so they are not relevant to ""pick it up"" in this context. Therefore, the knife on the floor is the object being referred to."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to an object on the floor that needs attention. Among the objects on the floor (spatula, plant, wet rag), the wet rag is a hazard due to being wet and on the floor, which could cause slipping or mess. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The spatula and plant are not hazards, and the wet rag is more urgent to pick up to prevent danger or mess."
broom,"Given the scene in the kitchen where Taylor is next to multiple objects on the floor and Jordan says ""pick it up,"" the most appropriate object to pick up is the broom. The broom is a cleaning tool and picking it up aligns with a tidying or cleaning task. Other objects like the lamp, laptop, and pen on the floor could be hazards or valuable items, but the broom is the most straightforward and relevant object to pick up for cleaning or tidying purposes. The book is on the table, so it is not the object referred to by ""pick it up"" in this context."
split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting likely refers to removing a hazard or cleaning up an item from the floor. Among the objects, the split mug on the floor represents a hazard that should be prioritized for cleanup (Norm 6 and Norm 7). The spatula is also on the floor but is not described as broken or hazardous. The book, lamp, and broom are on the table and not hazards. Therefore, the split mug is the most appropriate object to pick up."
broken plate,"Given the command ""pick it up"" and the scene in the garden with multiple objects on the floor and table, the priority should be to pick up the broken plate. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for removal to prevent danger. The broken plate is a hazard, unlike the book on the table or other objects on the floor, so it is the most appropriate object for Bailey to pick up."
banana peel,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to removing a hazard. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a banana peel on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning to prevent accidents. The banana peel is a clear hazard, whereas the notebook and pen on the floor are not hazards, and the spatula and broom are on the table and not relevant to the command. Therefore, the banana peel is the object Bailey is being asked to pick up."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting likely refers to tidying or cleaning up. According to Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or tidying tasks. The wet rag on the floor represents a potential hazard (slip risk), whereas the notebook and spatula on the floor are dirty but less hazardous. The book and lamp on the table are not on the floor and are not hazards. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."
split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in this context is likely referring to the object that poses a hazard or requires immediate attention. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken or split item on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Among the objects on the floor (pen, notebook, split mug, book), the split mug is a hazard and should be picked up first."
knife on the floor,"Morgan tells Riley to ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall setting. Among the objects, the knife on the floor represents a potential hazard that should be prioritized for picking up to prevent accidents. The lamp and pen on the floor are less hazardous, and the spatula and plant are on the table and less urgent to pick up. Following Norm 6 and Norm 7, the priority is to pick up hazards on the floor, so the knife is the most appropriate object to pick up."
split mug on the floor,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall setting where several objects are on the floor and table. According to Norm 7 and Norm 6, in a tidying or cleaning context, hazards like a broken or split mug on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup to prevent danger. The split mug is a hazard, unlike the book or lamp which are not described as broken or hazardous. Therefore, the object being referred to is the split mug on the floor."
shard of glass,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the living room and the objects present, the shard of glass is the most urgent object to pick up because it represents a hazard. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards like broken glass should be prioritized for removal to prevent injury. Other objects like the plant, notebook, broom, and spatula do not pose immediate danger, so the shard of glass is the appropriate object to pick up."
split mug,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the garden context likely refers to an object on the floor that needs attention. Among the objects on the floor, the split mug represents a hazard (broken item) which should be prioritized for cleaning or removal according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The spatula and broom on the floor are not hazards, and the notebook and plant are on the table, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the split mug is the object Jordan is referring to."
banana peel,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the kitchen context likely refers to removing a hazard or mess from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel is a clear hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning to prevent slipping. The plant and lamp on the floor are less likely to be hazards or messes to pick up immediately. The broom and book are on the table and not on the floor, so they are less relevant to the instruction. Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object to pick up."

The notebook and plant are not hazards, so the split mug is the most appropriate object to pick up."
notebook,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley, who is next to several objects on the floor and one on the table. Since the pen is on the table and not on the floor, it is less likely to be the target. The notebook, laptop, plant, and broom are all on the floor. Among these, the notebook is a common item that one might be asked to pick up in a garden setting, especially since it is on the floor and could be considered out of place or dirty. The plant is less likely to be ""picked up"" as it is a living object, and the broom is a tool for cleaning, not typically ""picked up"" as an object to move. The laptop is also on the floor but might be heavier or more delicate. Therefore, the notebook is the most plausible object Morgan is referring to for Riley to pick up."

Among the objects on the floor, the split mug represents a hazard (broken item) that should be prioritized for cleaning or removal according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The book and plant on the floor are not hazards, and the broom is a cleaning tool, not something to pick up. The spatula is on the table, so it is not the object to pick up from the floor. Therefore, the split mug is the most appropriate object to pick up."
knife on the floor,"Given the scene in the kitchen and the command ""pick it up,"" the most urgent and appropriate object to pick up is the knife on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a knife on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent danger. The book and lamp on the floor are less hazardous, and the broom and pen are on the table, so they are not the focus. Therefore, Riley should pick up the knife on the floor."
broken plate,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context, with Riley next to multiple objects on the floor, most likely refers to the broken plate. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The broken plate is a hazard, while the notebook and plant are not hazards.

broom,"In the banquet hall scene, Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up,"" referring to an object on the floor. Among the objects on the floor are a lamp, broom, spatula, and laptop. The lamp is likely a hazard on the floor, but lamps are typically not picked up casually as they may be heavy or fragile. The spatula and laptop are less likely to be the intended object for picking up in this context, as a spatula is a cooking tool and the laptop is valuable and may not be casually picked up without care. The broom is a cleaning tool and is commonly picked up to tidy or clean the area. Given the norms, picking up the broom aligns with tidying or cleaning tasks, and it is a straightforward object to pick up. Therefore, the broom is the most reasonable object Cameron refers to."
spatula,"In the restaurant setting, the instruction ""pick it up"" likely refers to removing a hazard or an item that should not be on the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the spatula is a kitchen tool and could be a hazard if left on the floor. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal.

Therefore, the shard of glass is the most appropriate object for Riley to pick up."
laptop,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley, who is next to several objects on the floor and table. According to the norms, in a tidying or cleaning context, one should prioritize picking up items on the floor to reduce hazards and clutter. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, broom, notebook), the laptop is a valuable and potentially fragile item that should be picked up to prevent damage or hazard. The broom is a cleaning tool and likely should remain on the floor for use, and the notebook, while on the floor, is less critical than the laptop. The pen and spatula are on the table and less likely to be the target of ""pick it up"" in this context. Therefore, the laptop on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
banana peel,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to removing a hazard or mess. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a banana peel on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup.

Among the objects on the floor (knife, plant, pen, spatula), the knife represents a potential hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. Picking up the knife prevents danger, making it the most appropriate object to pick up in this context."
split mug,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the garden setting, combined with the presence of a split mug on the floor, suggests that the object to be picked up is the split mug. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a broken or split item on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent danger. The broom and spatula on the floor are not described as hazards, and the broom is on the table, so the split mug on the floor is the most logical object to pick up."
broken plate,"Given the scene in a banquet hall and the command ""pick it up,"" the priority should be to address any hazards first (Norm 6 and Norm 7).

Among the objects on the floor (notebook, plant, spatula, wet rag), the wet rag is likely considered dirty or a hazard due to being wet and on the ground. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The wet rag fits this criterion better than the notebook, plant, or spatula, which are not inherently hazardous or dirty. Therefore, Taylor should pick up the wet rag."
lamp,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" while Riley is next to several objects on the floor: a lamp, a plant, a spatula, and a laptop. The book is on the table, so it is unlikely to be the referent. Among the objects on the floor, the lamp is a larger, more noticeable object that would commonly be picked up if left on the floor, possibly because it is out of place or a hazard. The plant and spatula are less likely to be the intended object since a lamp is more prominent and likely to be noticed first. The laptop might be fragile or in use, so less likely to be the target. Therefore, the lamp is the most reasonable object Riley is being asked to pick up."
banana peel,"Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up"" in the garden where several objects are on the floor and table. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. The banana peel on the floor is a hazard because it can cause slipping. Other objects on the floor include a broom and a lamp, but the lamp is not necessarily a hazard and the broom is a tool for cleaning, not a hazard itself. The spatula and book are on the table and not on the floor, so they are less likely to be the target of ""pick it up"" in this context. Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object to pick up."
knife,"Given the scene in the garden and the command ""pick it up,"" the most urgent and normatively prioritized object to pick up is the knife on the floor.

The pen and lamp are not hazards, and the broom and plant are on the table, so the broken plate is the most appropriate object to pick up."
pen,"In the garden scene, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up,"" referring to an object on the floor. Among the objects on the floor (pen, notebook, book, laptop, plant), the pen is the smallest and most likely to be easily picked up and tidied. There is no indication of hazards or dirtiness, so the simplest and most straightforward object to pick up is the pen. Additionally, picking up the pen aligns with a general tidying action without conflicting with any norms about hazards or ownership."

The phrase ""pick it up"" typically refers to an object on the floor that should be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor (plant, pen, laptop), the pen is the most likely candidate for picking up because the plant is less likely to be ""picked up"" casually and the laptop is a valuable item that might not be casually picked up without context. The pen is a small, movable item that fits the norm of tidying up objects on the floor. Therefore, the pen on the floor is the object being referred to."
wet rag,"The phrase ""pick it up"" implies an object on the floor that needs to be removed or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag is a potential hazard or mess that should be cleaned up, aligning with Norm 6 and Norm 7 about prioritizing hazards. The plant is not typically something to pick up in this context, and the book, broom, and pen are on the table, so they are not the target. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object for Taylor to pick up."
broken plate,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the kitchen setting, combined with the presence of a broken plate on the floor, suggests a cleaning or tidying task. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup.

Among the objects on the floor (plant, spatula, wet rag), the wet rag is the most plausible item to pick up because it is likely dirty or out of place and needs to be tidied or cleaned up. The plant is less likely to be picked up as it is a decorative item and the spatula might be a kitchen tool but is less likely to be the immediate target for picking up compared to the wet rag, which is a cleaning item and probably needs to be handled. The book and lamp are on the table and less likely to be referred to by ""pick it up"" in this context."

Banana peels are hazardous as they can cause slipping, so picking it up aligns with the norm of prioritizing cleaning up hazards (Norm 6 and Norm 7). The spatula is also on the floor but is less likely to be a hazard compared to the banana peel. The notebook, pen, and plant are on the table and not on the floor, so they are less likely to be the intended object for ""pick it up"" in this context."
spatula on the floor,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" in the kitchen setting. Among the objects on the floor, the spatula is a kitchen tool and likely the intended object to be picked up.

wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the kitchen context suggests a tidying or cleaning task. According to Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag is likely to be a hazard due to its wetness, which could cause slipping. The spatula, plant, and pen are less likely to be hazards, and the notebook is on the table, so it is not relevant. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."
broken plate,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the dining room context, combined with the presence of a broken plate on the floor, suggests a cleaning or tidying task.

spatula on the floor,"Alex says ""pick it up"" to Bailey, who is next to several objects including a pen and broom on the table, and a spatula, laptop, and lamp on the floor. Norm 7 states that in general, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or tidying. Objects on the floor, especially in a kitchen, can be hazards. Among the objects on the floor, the spatula is a kitchen tool and more likely to be relevant to the kitchen setting than a laptop or lamp, which are less typical kitchen items and may be considered less urgent or less appropriate to pick up in this context. Therefore, the spatula on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up, as it is a potential hazard and relevant to the kitchen environment."
banana peel,"In this scene, Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall where several objects are on the floor, including a banana peel, lamp, spatula, and pen.

The plant, broom, and notebook are on the table and do not represent hazards, and the lamp is on the floor but not described as broken or hazardous. Therefore, the split mug on the floor is the object that Bailey is being asked to pick up."
broom,"In this scene, Morgan tells Riley to ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall where multiple objects are on the floor: a book, laptop, lamp, broom, and notebook. According to the norms, in a tidying or cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized (Norm 6 and Norm 7). Among these objects, the broom is a cleaning tool and likely the most relevant object to pick up for tidying or cleaning purposes. The other items are personal or electronic items that are less likely to be hazards or cleaning tools. Therefore, the broom is the most appropriate object for Riley to pick up."
shard of glass on the floor,"Given the scene in the banquet hall and the command ""pick it up,"" the most urgent and appropriate object to pick up is the shard of glass on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as broken glass should be prioritized for removal to prevent danger. The shard of glass is a hazard on the floor, unlike the pen or plant, which are not hazards. The spatula and lamp are on the table and not hazards, so they are less likely to be the target. Therefore, Riley should pick up the shard of glass to ensure safety."
wet rag on the floor,"Given the scene in a restaurant and the instruction ""pick it up,"" the most appropriate object to pick up is the wet rag on the floor. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. A wet rag on the floor can be a slipping hazard, so it should be picked up first.

notebook on the floor,"Alex says to Bailey ""pick it up"" while Bailey is next to multiple objects on the floor. Among these objects, the notebook is a common item that one would typically pick up when asked, especially in a garden setting where it might be out of place or at risk of damage. The pen is on the table, so it is less likely to be the target. The lamp, laptop, and plant are larger or more cumbersome items, and the instruction ""pick it up"" without further specification most naturally applies to the notebook, which is small and portable. There is no indication of hazard or dirtiness, so the simplest interpretation is to pick up the notebook."

Therefore, the split mug is the most appropriate object for Skyler to pick up."
laptop,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler, who is next to several objects on the floor and table. The objects on the floor are the laptop, spatula, and pen. Since the setting is a banquet hall and the instruction is to pick something up, the most likely object to pick up is the laptop because it is valuable and likely needs to be moved or tidied. The spatula and pen are less likely targets in this context. The book and broom are on the table, so ""pick it up"" likely refers to something on the floor. Therefore, the laptop is the most reasonable object to be referred to."
dirty notebook,"The scene is in a banquet hall where multiple objects are on the floor: a plant, book, lamp, notebook, and laptop. Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up,"" which implies tidying or cleaning up. According to Norm 2 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards or dirty items. Among the objects, the notebook is most likely to be dirty or in need of cleaning compared to the plant, lamp, or laptop, which are less likely to be dirty or hazardous. The book and laptop are less likely to be dirty or hazardous than the notebook. Therefore, the ""dirty notebook"" is the most appropriate object to pick up."
banana peel,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context suggests removing a hazard or mess. Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel is a clear hazard that could cause someone to slip, so it should be prioritized for picking up.

The laptop is a significant item that should not be left on the floor, making it the most reasonable choice."
split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is ambiguous, but given the norms, the priority is to pick up hazards first.

Therefore, the split mug is the most appropriate object to pick up."
broken plate,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall where there is a broken plate on the floor, the most appropriate object to pick up is the broken plate to prevent danger and maintain safety."
broom,"The phrase ""pick it up"" implies an object on the floor that should be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, broom, spatula, pen), the broom is the most appropriate to pick up because it is a cleaning tool and likely intended to be used for tidying. The laptop is valuable and typically not something you just pick up casually, the spatula is a kitchen tool and might not belong in the living room, and the pen is small and less likely to be the intended object. The broom is the most logical object to pick up in this context."
knife on the floor,"Given the scene in a restaurant and the instruction ""pick it up,"" the most relevant object to pick up is the knife on the floor. Knives on the floor represent a hazard (sharp object on the ground), and according to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal.

laptop,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies picking up an object from the floor or a place where it is not properly placed. Among the objects, the laptop and pen are on the floor, while the notebook, broom, and book are on the table. Picking up the laptop is more likely the intended action because it is a larger, more significant item that should not be on the floor in a restaurant setting, whereas the pen is small and less likely to be the focus. Therefore, the laptop is the most reasonable object to pick up."
knife on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies an object that is on the floor and needs to be picked up. Among the objects on the floor, there is a spatula and a knife. Both are kitchen tools, but the knife on the floor represents a potential hazard, which should be prioritized for picking up to prevent danger. The spatula is less hazardous. The notebook and plant are on the table and do not need to be picked up, and the broom is also on the table. Therefore, the knife on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."

Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object to pick up."
shard of glass on the floor,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting and the objects nearby, the shard of glass on the floor represents a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. Picking up the shard of glass prevents danger and maintains safety, which takes precedence over other objects like the pen, plant, notebook, or spatula."
wet rag,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall setting, the priority is to pick up an object that is likely a hazard or needs cleaning. Among the objects on the floor (lamp, broom, spatula, wet rag), the wet rag is the most likely to be a hazard (wet and on the floor) and in need of immediate attention. The broom is a cleaning tool, not something to pick up as an object, and the lamp and spatula are less likely to be hazards or dirty items. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."

Therefore, the shard of glass is the most appropriate object to pick up."
notebook,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up,"" and Riley is next to several objects, including a spatula on the table and multiple items on the floor (notebook, laptop, plant). In a restaurant setting, picking up an item from the floor is more likely than picking up an item from the table, especially since the spatula and book on the table are likely in use or clean and placed properly. The notebook on the floor is a plausible target for picking up because it is out of place and on the floor, which aligns with the norm of tidying or cleaning up items that are misplaced or hazards. Among the floor items, the notebook is a common object to pick up, and it is not a hazard like broken glass, so it fits the instruction best."
book on the floor,"Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up"" in the dining room where multiple objects are on the floor: a book, a laptop, a lamp, and a pen. Among these, the book is the most likely object to be picked up because it is a common item that is typically tidied up when found on the floor. The broom is on the table, so it is not the target. The laptop and lamp on the floor could be hazards, but since the instruction is simply ""pick it up"" without specifying hazard removal, the book is the most straightforward and appropriate object to pick up in this context."
shard of glass,"The shard of glass on the floor represents a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7.

Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object for Charlie to pick up."

The phrase ""pick it up"" typically refers to an object on the floor that needs to be removed or tidied. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, plant, lamp, broom), the laptop is the most likely object to be referred to because it is a valuable item that should not be left on the floor, and it is not a cleaning tool like the broom. The pen is on the table, so it is less likely to be the object to pick up. Therefore, the laptop is the most reasonable object Riley is being asked to pick up."

broom,"Given the command ""pick it up"" and the scene in the kitchen where multiple objects are on the floor, the most appropriate object to pick up is the broom. The broom is a cleaning tool and picking it up aligns with tidying or cleaning tasks. Other objects like the lamp, book, and laptop on the floor could be hazards or valuable items, but the broom is the most straightforward and relevant object to pick up in this context. The pen is on the table, so it is not the target. Picking up the broom helps in cleaning or tidying the kitchen."

book on the floor,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler, who is next to multiple objects on the floor and table. The objects on the floor are the laptop, book, and lamp. The broom and pen are on the table, so less likely to be referred to by ""pick it up"" in this context. Among the floor objects, the book is a common item that one would pick up from the floor, especially in a garden setting where it might have been dropped. The laptop and lamp are more valuable or fragile, and the instruction ""pick it up"" without further specification likely refers to the simpler, less fragile object. Therefore, the book on the floor is the most plausible referent."
shard of glass,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" while Riley is next to multiple objects on the floor, including a shard of glass, broom, plant, and lamp. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as broken glass should be prioritized for removal.

wet rag,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the living room scene, the most appropriate object to pick up is the wet rag on the floor. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or tidying tasks. A wet rag on the floor can be a slipping hazard, so it should be picked up first. The book and pen on the floor are not hazards, and the lamp is on the table, so it is not relevant. The broom is a tool for cleaning but is not something to pick up as an item causing clutter or hazard. Therefore, the wet rag is the object being referred to."

Therefore, the banana peel is the object being referred to for pickup."
pen,"In the banquet hall setting, Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up,"" which implies a tidying or cleaning task. According to the norms, in a tidying task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards or items on the floor. Among the objects on the floor (pen, notebook, laptop, spatula), the pen is a small, easily picked-up item that is likely out of place and not hazardous but still appropriate to pick up first. The broom is on the table and not on the floor, so it is not the target. The laptop and notebook might be more personal or in use, and the spatula is misspelled but presumably a kitchen tool, less relevant in a banquet hall. Therefore, the pen is the most reasonable object to pick up."
broken plate,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is given by Jordan to Taylor in the garden where multiple objects are on the floor, including a broken plate, pen, plant, and broom. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the ground should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken plate is a hazard, so Taylor should pick it up first."
notebook,"Casey says to Skyler ""pick it up"" in the kitchen where several objects are on the floor: a notebook, a spatula, a laptop, and a broom. The plant is on the table and thus not relevant for picking up. Among the objects on the floor, the notebook is a common item that would be expected to be picked up to tidy the area. The spatula and broom are kitchen tools, but the spatula is misspelled and might be less likely to be casually picked up without context, and the broom is typically used for cleaning rather than being picked up as an object to tidy. The laptop is valuable but might be heavier or more delicate, and the instruction ""pick it up"" is more likely referring to a simpler object. Therefore, the notebook is the most plausible object being referred to for picking up."
broken plate,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting, combined with the presence of a broken plate on the floor, suggests a cleaning or tidying task.

The spatula and pen on the table are not on the floor and are not hazards, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the broken plate is the object being referred to."
banana peel on the floor,"Morgan tells Riley to ""pick it up"" in the kitchen scene. Among the objects, the banana peel on the floor is a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning or removal according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The pen on the floor is not a hazard, and the plant, lamp, and broom are on the table and not on the floor. Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object to pick up."
pen on the floor,"Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up,"" and among the objects present, the pen and laptop are on the floor, which is unusual and likely needs attention. Since the pen is smaller and more likely to be picked up quickly, and picking up the laptop might be more cumbersome, the pen on the floor is the most probable object being referred to. Additionally, picking up items from the floor aligns with tidying or cleaning norms, prioritizing removing objects from the floor to maintain cleanliness and order."
knife,"The knife on the floor represents a hazard, which should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. Since Alex is telling Bailey to ""pick it up,"" it is most logical that Bailey should pick up the hazardous object to prevent danger.

lamp on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies removing an object from the floor. Among the objects on the floor (lamp, laptop, notebook), the lamp is a potential hazard due to its fragility and the risk of damage or injury. Prioritizing safety and hazard removal aligns with Norm 6 and Norm 7, which emphasize cleaning hazards first. Therefore, the lamp on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is given in a kitchen setting where several objects are on the floor and table. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag is a hazard and dirty item that should be cleaned up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7, which prioritize cleaning hazards and dirty items. The spatula and pen on the floor are not hazards, and the lamp and book on the table are not on the floor and thus less likely to be the target. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object for Riley to pick up."
split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room context likely refers to an object that needs to be cleaned or removed due to being a hazard or dirty. Among the objects on the floor, the split mug represents a hazard (broken item) and should be prioritized for picking up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The book and spatula on the floor are less urgent, and the plant and pen are on the table, so they are not the target. Therefore, the split mug is the object Bailey is being asked to pick up."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies a tidying or cleaning task. According to the norms, in a tidying task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards or dirty items. Among the objects on the floor, the wet rag is likely dirty or messy and represents a tidying priority over other objects like the spatula or plant. The lamp and pen are on the table and less likely to be the target for ""pick it up"" in this context. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies an object on the floor that should be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor (pen, wet rag, plant, spatula), the wet rag is the most likely candidate for being picked up because it is a cleaning item that is out of place and possibly dirty or wet, which aligns with tidying or cleaning norms. The pen and spatula are less likely to be prioritized for picking up in a garden setting, and the plant might be a living item that is not typically ""picked up"" but rather cared for. The broom is on the table and not on the floor, so it is not the target. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."
pen,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in a garden setting with multiple objects on the floor, the most likely object to be referred to is the pen. The pen is a small, portable item that is commonly picked up when found on the ground. Other items like the laptop, broom, plant, and lamp are larger or less likely to be casually picked up without further instruction. Since there is no indication of a cleaning or serving task, and no hazards mentioned, the simplest and most reasonable interpretation is that Alex is asking Bailey to pick up the pen."
shard of glass,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a shard of glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since Jordan says ""pick it up"" to Taylor in the kitchen where there is a shard of glass on the floor, the most reasonable object to refer to is the shard of glass, as it represents a hazard that needs immediate attention."
notebook,"Jordan says to Taylor ""pick it up,"" which implies Taylor should pick up an object from the floor. Among the objects on the floor (notebook, pen, wet rag), the notebook is a clear, non-hazardous item that is appropriate to pick up in a restaurant setting. The wet rag might be considered a cleaning item, and the pen is small and less likely to be the intended object. The notebook is the most likely object being referred to for picking up."
laptop on the floor,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler, who is next to multiple objects on the floor and one on the table. Since the setting is a restaurant and the objects on the floor include a laptop, book, lamp, and plant, the most likely object to be picked up is the laptop on the floor. The notebook is on the table and likely in use or placed properly, so it is less likely to be the target. Among the floor objects, the laptop is a valuable item that should be picked up to prevent damage or hazard. The book, lamp, and plant are less likely to be the immediate focus. Therefore, the laptop on the floor is the most reasonable object to pick up."
wet rag,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the garden setting, the most appropriate object to pick up is the wet rag on the floor. The wet rag is likely considered a hazard or something that should be cleaned up to maintain tidiness and safety. Other objects like the spatula, pen, and plant are on the floor but do not present an immediate hazard or need for cleaning. The lamp is on the table and not on the floor, so it is not relevant to the command. Therefore, the wet rag is the best choice to pick up."
knife on the floor,"Given the scene in the kitchen and the instruction ""pick it up,"" the most urgent and appropriate object to pick up is the knife on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a knife on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or tidying to prevent danger. Other objects like the book, broom, and plant on the floor are not hazards, and the lamp is on the table and not relevant to picking up. Therefore, the knife on the floor is the object being referred to."
knife on the floor,"Given the instruction ""pick it up"" in the dining room and the presence of multiple objects on the floor, the priority should be to pick up any hazards first. The knife on the floor represents a potential hazard, so according to Norm 6 and Norm 7, it should be prioritized for picking up over other items like the book, notebook, or pen."
notebook on the floor,"Jordan says ""pick it up"" to Taylor, who is next to multiple objects on the floor: a notebook, a book, a laptop, and a plant. Since the instruction is to pick up a single object and the scene is a restaurant, the most likely object to pick up is the notebook on the floor. The notebook is a common item that might have fallen and needs to be picked up, whereas the laptop might be heavier or more valuable, and the plant might be decorative or fragile. The book is also on the floor but less likely than the notebook in this context. The pen is on the table, so it is not relevant to ""pick it up"" from the floor. Therefore, the notebook on the floor is the best fit for the referred object."
knife,"In the dining room scene, Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up."" Among the objects on the floor (knife, spatula, broom), the knife represents a potential hazard.

Therefore, the object being referred to is the knife."
wet rag,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in a living room setting with multiple objects on the floor, the most likely object to be referred to is the wet rag. This is because a wet rag on the floor is a potential hazard (it could cause slipping), and according to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The broom and spatula are tools and might be less urgent, the pen is small and less hazardous, and the book is on the table, not on the floor. Therefore, the wet rag is the most reasonable object for Bailey to pick up."
banana peel,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a tidying or cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized. The banana peel on the floor represents a hazard that could cause someone to slip and fall.

pen,"Morgan says to Riley ""pick it up"" while Riley is next to multiple objects on the floor: a laptop, a broom, and a pen. The lamp and notebook are on the table, so they are unlikely targets for ""pick it up"" in this context. The broom is a cleaning tool and might be intended for use rather than picking up.

Given the norms and the context, the pen is the most plausible object Riley is being asked to pick up."
shard of glass,"Given the scene in the dining room where Bailey is next to multiple objects on the floor, and Alex says ""pick it up,"" the priority should be to pick up the shard of glass.

According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as broken glass should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent danger. The shard of glass is a hazard on the floor, so Bailey should pick it up. Other objects like the lamp, plant, pen, and broom are either on the table or not hazardous, so they are less relevant to the instruction."
broken plate,"Given the scene in the kitchen and the instruction ""pick it up,"" the most appropriate object to pick up is the broken plate on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as broken plates on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup to prevent danger. The broken plate is a hazard, unlike the pen or plant on the floor, and the notebook and book are on the table and not hazardous. Therefore, the broken plate is the object being referred to."
split mug,"In the restaurant setting, Morgan tells Riley to ""pick it up,"" which implies a tidying or cleaning task. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a broken or split mug on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup.

broom,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley in the living room where multiple objects are on the floor: a broom, spatula, plant, and laptop. Among these, the broom is a common household item that is typically picked up to tidy or clean the room. The spatula is a kitchen tool and less likely to be relevant in the living room context. The plant might be decorative or fragile, and the laptop is valuable and usually handled carefully, not just ""picked up"" casually. The pen is on the table, so it is not the target. Therefore, the broom is the most reasonable object Morgan refers to for picking up."
banana peel,"In the kitchen scene, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel represents a hazard (slipping risk) and should be prioritized for cleaning or removal according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. The broom is a cleaning tool, not something to pick up as an object, and the notebook and book, while on the floor, are not hazards. The pen is on the table, so it is not relevant. Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object to pick up."
broken plate,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for picking up.

Therefore, the knife is the object being referred to."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting likely refers to an item that should be cleaned or removed from the floor to maintain cleanliness and safety. According to Norm 7, hazards or dirty items on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning.

Other items like the pen and lamp are also on the floor, but the wet rag is more relevant to cleaning tasks in a restaurant environment."
laptop on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies that Skyler should pick up an object that is on the floor and likely out of place or a hazard. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, plant, spatula, broom), the laptop is the most likely to be considered important and potentially hazardous if left on the floor, as it could be damaged or cause someone to trip. The plant and broom are less likely to be hazards, and the spatula is a kitchen tool but not necessarily a priority to pick up. The book is on the table, so it is not the object to pick up. Therefore, the laptop on the floor is the most reasonable object to be referred to by ""pick it up."""
shard of glass,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the kitchen context likely refers to removing a hazard.

According to Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning.

broom,"In the restaurant setting, Morgan tells Riley to ""pick it up."" Among the objects present, the broom and laptop are on the floor, while the plant, book, and pen are on the table. Picking up an object from the floor is more likely the intended action. The broom is a cleaning tool and picking it up aligns with tidying or cleaning tasks, which is a reasonable interpretation here. The laptop on the floor could be a hazard, but since the broom is a cleaning tool and more appropriate to pick up in this context, it is the best choice."
wet rag on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies a tidying or cleaning task. According to the norms, in a tidying task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards or dirty items on the floor.

laptop on the floor,"Jordan says ""pick it up"" to Taylor, who is next to several objects on the table and floor. Among these, the laptop and notebook are on the floor, which is an unusual and potentially hazardous or untidy location in a banquet hall setting. Norm 7 states that hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or tidying. Since the laptop is a valuable and fragile item on the floor, it is the most likely object Jordan is referring to for picking up to prevent damage or hazard. The plant, lamp, and book are on the table and not in need of picking up, and the notebook, while also on the floor, is less likely to be the immediate concern compared to the laptop."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is given by Morgan to Riley in the dining room.

Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to be referred to for picking up."
wet rag,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley, who is next to several objects including a pen, book, wet rag, broom, and notebook. According to the norms, in a tidying or cleaning context, priority is given to cleaning up hazards or dirty items, especially those on the floor. The wet rag on the floor is dirty and on the ground, making it a priority to pick up to prevent hazards or mess. The book is also on the floor but is not described as dirty or hazardous. The pen, broom, and notebook are on the table and thus less likely to be the intended object to pick up. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object Riley is being asked to pick up."
wet rag,"Given the instruction ""pick it up"" in a garden setting and the objects on the floor, the wet rag is the most likely target because it is a dirty or messy item that should be cleaned up or removed. The broom is a tool for cleaning, not something to pick up as an object to be tidied. The notebook, lamp, and plant are less likely to be the intended object since the rag is clearly dirty and picking it up aligns with tidying or cleaning norms, prioritizing removing dirty or hazardous items from the floor."

split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the garden setting likely refers to an object that needs to be cleaned up or removed due to being a hazard or out of place. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken or split item on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The split mug on the floor represents a hazard, whereas the notebook and plant on the table are not hazards, and the broom is a tool rather than an object to be picked up. The lamp on the floor could be considered, but a split mug is a clearer hazard. Therefore, the split mug is the object Cameron is referring to."
shard of glass,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a tidying or cleaning task, hazards such as broken glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since Alex says ""pick it up"" and Bailey is next to multiple objects on the floor, the shard of glass represents a hazard that must be removed first to ensure safety."
notebook,"Casey says to Skyler ""pick it up"" in the dining room where multiple objects are on the floor: a notebook, laptop, book, and pen. Since the instruction is to pick up ""it,"" the most likely referent is an object that is appropriate to pick up and tidy. Among the items, the notebook is a common item to be tidied up from the floor. The laptop might be heavier or less likely to be casually picked up, and the pen and book are also possible but less likely than the notebook as a typical item to pick up in this context. There is no indication of hazards or dirtiness, so the simplest interpretation is that ""it"" refers to the notebook on the floor."

The plant and pen are on the table and less likely to be the target of ""pick it up"" since they are already placed properly. Therefore, the laptop is the most reasonable object to be referred to for picking up."
knife on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context suggests removing an object from the floor. Among the objects on the floor, the knife represents a hazard, which should be prioritized for picking up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7.

split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting likely refers to removing a hazard or mess. The split mug on the floor is a hazard (broken object) and should be prioritized for cleaning up according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. Other objects like the book and lamp are on the table and not hazards, and the broom and spatula on the floor are tools, not hazards. Therefore, the split mug is the object Bailey is being asked to pick up."
laptop,"The phrase ""pick it up"" typically refers to an object on the floor that should be removed or tidied. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, pen, spatula, book), the laptop is a valuable and likely important item that should be picked up first. The broom is on the table, so it is not the target. The pen, spatula, and book are also on the floor, but the laptop is the most prominent and likely the intended object to be picked up in this context."
broken plate,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" in a living room setting where multiple objects are on the floor, including a broken plate, a notebook, and a book. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken plate represents a hazard, so Riley should pick it up first to prevent danger."
pen,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies that Skyler should pick up an object from the floor. Among the objects on the floor (pen, laptop, book), the pen is the most likely candidate for being picked up because it is a small, portable item that is commonly picked up when found on the floor. The laptop and book are larger and less likely to be casually picked up without further context. Therefore, the pen is the most reasonable object to refer to in this context."
broom,"The instruction ""pick it up"" refers to an object on the floor near Bailey. Among the objects on the floor (broom, pen, laptop, plant), the broom is the most likely candidate for being picked up in a garden setting, as it is a tool typically used for cleaning or tidying. The pen, laptop, and plant are less likely to be intended for immediate picking up in this context. Additionally, the notebook is on the table, so it is not the target. Therefore, the broom is the most appropriate object to pick up."
shard of glass,"Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall setting. Among the objects present, the shard of glass on the floor represents a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning or removal (Norm 6 and Norm 7). The book on the floor is dirty or out of place but is less hazardous than broken glass. The pen, broom, and plant are on the table and not hazards. Therefore, the shard of glass is the most appropriate object to pick up."
broken plate,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley in the living room where there are several objects on the floor including a plant, lamp, broken plate, and spatula. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The broken plate is a hazard and should be picked up first to prevent danger, making it the most likely object Morgan is referring to."
wet rag,"In the banquet hall scene, Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up."" Among the objects on the floor (plant, wet rag, lamp, pen), the wet rag is the most likely candidate for immediate attention because it could be a hazard due to being wet and on the floor, potentially causing someone to slip. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. The plant, lamp, and pen do not inherently represent hazards. The spatula is on the table and not on the floor, so it is not relevant to ""pick up"" in this context."
banana peel,"In the restaurant setting, Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up."" Among the objects on the floor, the banana peel represents a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent accidents. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning tasks. The notebook, book, and spatula are not hazards, and the lamp is on the table, so the banana peel is the most appropriate object to pick up."
lamp,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies the object is on the floor and needs to be picked up. Among the objects on the floor (lamp, broom, laptop), the lamp is a likely candidate because it is a distinct object that is out of place on the floor and could be considered a hazard or something that should be tidied up. The broom is a cleaning tool and likely meant to be on the floor, and the laptop, while on the floor, is less likely to be the immediate object to pick up in this context. Therefore, the lamp is the most reasonable object for Bailey to pick up."
banana peel,"In this scene, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up"" in a banquet hall where several objects are on the floor: a spatula, a lamp, a banana peel, and a broom. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized for cleanup. The banana peel is a clear hazard as it can cause someone to slip and fall. The spatula, lamp, and broom are not hazards. Therefore, the object being referred to for picking up is the banana peel."
lamp,"In the restaurant scene, Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up,"" referring to an object on the floor.

knife on the floor,"Given the scene in a restaurant and the command ""pick it up,"" the most appropriate object to pick up is the knife on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a knife on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent danger. The pen, notebook, and spatula on the floor are less hazardous, and the plant on the table is not on the floor and is likely decorative, so it should not be picked up. Therefore, the knife on the floor is the object being referred to."
book on the floor,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley, who is next to several objects on the floor. In a restaurant setting, picking up a book from the floor is more likely to be the intended object than a laptop, pen, or notebook, as books on the floor are unusual and may be considered a hazard or untidy. The broom on the table is not on the floor and is unlikely to be the target. Since the instruction is to ""pick it up,"" the book on the floor is the most plausible object to be referred to."
laptop on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies tidying or cleaning up an object that is out of place. Among the objects, the laptop, notebook, and lamp are on the floor, which is generally considered untidy or hazardous. The laptop is a valuable and potentially hazardous object if left on the floor, so prioritizing picking it up aligns with the norm to prioritize cleaning hazards or items on the floor. The book and spatula are on the table and do not need to be picked up. Therefore, the laptop on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
knife on the floor,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the living room and the objects present, the knife on the floor represents a hazard that should be prioritized for removal according to Norm 6 and Norm 7. Picking up the knife prevents potential danger, which takes precedence over other objects like the book or pen on the floor or items on the table."

notebook,"The phrase ""pick it up"" typically refers to an object that is on the floor and likely out of place or needs tidying. Among the objects on the floor (notebook, lamp, broom, laptop), the notebook is the most likely candidate for being picked up because it is a common item that should not be left on the floor, unlike the broom which might be used for cleaning or the lamp which could be broken or hazardous but is less likely to be casually picked up without further instruction. The notebook is also not decorative or hazardous, making it the most reasonable object for Cameron to ask Charlie to pick up."
split mug,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in a restaurant setting likely refers to removing a hazard or mess. Among the objects on the floor, the split mug is both hazardous and dirty, making it a priority to clean up. The lamp and spatula on the floor may also be out of place, but the split mug poses a greater risk due to being broken.

book on the floor,"The phrase ""pick it up"" in the living room context likely refers to an object that is out of place and should be tidied. Among the objects on the floor, the book is a common item that people are asked to pick up to tidy the space.

Therefore, the book on the floor is the most reasonable object for Taylor to pick up."
book on the floor,"In the dining room scene, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" Among the objects on the floor (book, plant, laptop), the book is the most typical item to be picked up in a general tidying context. The lamp and broom are on the table, so they are less likely to be the target of ""pick it up"" since they are already placed properly. The plant and laptop on the floor might be less likely to be picked up casually, as the plant might be decorative and the laptop is a valuable electronic device that might not be casually moved.

Therefore, the knife on the floor is the object that Skyler should pick up."
wet rag,"The instruction ""pick it up"" is given in a kitchen setting where multiple objects are on the floor: a wet rag, a pen, a lamp, and a spatula. According to Norm 7 and Norm 6, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or picking up. Among these objects, the wet rag on the floor is likely a hazard (wet and on the floor), which should be picked up first to prevent slipping or contamination. The lamp and pen are less likely hazards, and the spatula is a kitchen tool but on the floor, so it is less urgent than a wet rag hazard. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object to pick up."
wet rag,"In the banquet hall setting, Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up,"" which implies a cleaning or tidying task. According to the norms, in a tidying or cleaning task, hazards and dirty items on the floor should be prioritized.

wet rag on the floor,"The phrase ""pick it up"" typically implies removing something from the floor or a lower surface, especially in a context where tidying or cleaning is implied. Among the objects present, the wet rag is on the floor, which makes it the most likely candidate for being referred to.

broom,"In the restaurant setting, Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up,"" which implies a tidying or cleaning task. According to Norm 7 and Norm Conflict 2, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. Among the objects on the floor (broom, laptop, lamp, book), the broom is a cleaning tool and not a hazard itself, but the laptop and lamp on the floor could be hazards. However, the broom is the most logical object to pick up because it is a tool used for cleaning and is on the floor, making it the most relevant object to pick up in this context. The plant is on the table and not on the floor, so it is less likely to be the target. The laptop and lamp might be fragile or in use, so picking them up might not be appropriate.

Among the objects on the floor (book, notebook, wet rag), the wet rag is likely considered a hazard or mess that needs immediate attention, aligning with Norm 6 and Norm 7 about prioritizing hazards. The book and notebook, while on the floor, are not hazards and may not require immediate picking up. Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the most appropriate object for Skyler to pick up."
knife,"In the restaurant setting, Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up,"" which implies a tidying or cleaning task. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a knife on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup to prevent danger. The knife on the floor is a clear hazard compared to other objects like the book, pen, or lamp. Therefore, Bailey should pick up the knife first."
banana peel,"The instruction ""pick it up"" in the living room context suggests tidying or cleaning. Among the objects on the floor (plant, banana peel, pen, book), the banana peel is a hazard because it can cause slipping. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning. Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object for Riley to pick up."
broken plate,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a broken plate on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. Since Alex says ""pick it up"" to Bailey in the kitchen where multiple objects are on the floor, the broken plate represents a hazard that should be addressed first before other items like the broom, book, pen, or spatula."
knife on the floor,"In the restaurant setting, Morgan tells Riley to ""pick it up."" Among the objects, the knife on the floor represents a potential hazard that should be prioritized for picking up to ensure safety. The lamp is also on the floor but is less likely to be hazardous compared to a knife. The notebook, broom, and plant are on the table and not in need of immediate picking up. Following Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or picking up."
laptop,"The command ""pick it up"" in the banquet hall context likely refers to an object on the floor that needs to be tidied or cleaned up. Among the objects on the floor (laptop, broom, pen), the laptop is a valuable item that should not be left on the floor, and picking it up aligns with tidying or preventing damage. The broom is a cleaning tool and likely should not be picked up as an object to tidy, and the pen is small and less likely the intended object. Therefore, the laptop is the most reasonable object Taylor is being asked to pick up."
wet rag on the floor,"The instruction ""pick it up"" implies a tidying or cleaning task. According to the norms, in a tidying or cleaning task, one should prioritize picking up hazards or dirty items on the floor. The wet rag on the floor is both dirty and on the floor, making it a priority to pick up. The pen is also on the floor but is not necessarily dirty or hazardous. The spatula, broom, and book are on the table and thus less relevant for ""pick it up"" in this context."
shard of glass,"In the banquet hall scene, Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards such as a shard of glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The shard of glass is a hazard on the floor, unlike the lamp, plant, spatula, or book. Therefore, the object being referred to is the shard of glass."
book on the floor,"Casey says ""pick it up"" to Skyler in the living room where multiple objects are on the floor. Among these objects, the book on the floor is the most likely target because it is a common item that should be tidied up when found on the floor. The laptop and notebook might be in use or valuable, and the broom is a cleaning tool rather than something to pick up. The lamp on the floor could be a hazard, but since the instruction is simply ""pick it up"" without specifying hazard removal, the book is the most straightforward and appropriate object to pick up in this context."
banana peel,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in a kitchen setting, the most appropriate object to pick up is the banana peel on the floor. The banana peel represents a hazard (it can cause slipping), so according to Norm 6 and Norm 7, it should be prioritized for cleaning up. The pen and broom are also on the floor, but the pen is not a hazard and the broom is a tool likely used for cleaning, not something to pick up. The plant and lamp are on the table and not on the floor, so they are less likely to be the target of ""pick it up"" in this context. Therefore, the banana peel is the object being referred to."
wet rag on the floor,"Given the scene in a restaurant and the command ""pick it up,"" the most appropriate object to pick up is the wet rag on the floor. According to Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or removal. A wet rag on the floor can be a slipping hazard, so it should be picked up first.

broom,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the dining room scene, the most appropriate object to pick up is the broom. The broom is on the floor and is likely considered a hazard or an item that should not be left on the floor, aligning with Norm 7 (prioritize cleaning up hazards). The notebook, spatula, and laptop are also on the floor, but the broom is more clearly a cleaning tool and likely a hazard or obstruction. The lamp is on the table and not on the floor, so it is not the target. Therefore, the broom is the best choice for ""pick it up."""
shard of glass on the floor,"Given the scene in a banquet hall and the command ""pick it up,"" the most urgent and appropriate object to pick up is the shard of glass on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards like broken glass should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent injury. The shard of glass is a hazard, unlike the book, lamp, spatula, or pen. Therefore, Skyler should pick up the shard of glass to ensure safety."
banana peel,"According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning or tidying task, hazards should be prioritized. A banana peel on the floor is a clear hazard as it can cause someone to slip and fall. The other objects (plant, lamp, spatula, notebook) are not inherently hazardous. Therefore, the object Morgan is referring to with ""pick it up"" is the banana peel."

wet rag on the floor,"Morgan says ""pick it up"" to Riley in the garden where several objects are present. Among these, the wet rag on the floor is the most likely object to be referred to because it is on the floor and could be considered out of place or a hazard. Norm 7 states that in general, you should prioritize cleaning up any hazards. A wet rag on the floor could be slippery or messy, so it makes sense to pick it up. Other objects like the pen and book are on the table and less likely to be the target of ""pick it up"" in this context, and the plant and lamp on the floor are less likely to be casually picked up without further instruction."
notebook on the floor,"Casey says to Skyler ""pick it up,"" and Skyler is next to several objects on the floor and table. Among the objects on the floor (notebook, lamp, laptop), the notebook is a common item that might be expected to be picked up in a living room setting. The lamp and laptop are also on the floor but picking up a lamp or laptop might be less likely without further context. The pen and spatula are on the table, so ""pick it up"" likely refers to an object on the floor near Skyler. Since the notebook is on the floor and presumably not hazardous or decorative, it fits the natural interpretation of ""pick it up"" in this context."
knife on the floor,"Given the command ""pick it up"" in the dining room and the objects present, the priority is to pick up any hazards first (Norm 6 and Norm 7). Among the objects on the floor (pen, broom, knife), the knife is a potential hazard due to its sharpness and danger. Therefore, the appropriate object for Skyler to pick up is the knife on the floor."
knife on the floor,"Given the scene in a banquet hall and the instruction ""pick it up,"" the most appropriate object to pick up is the knife on the floor. According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards such as a knife on the floor should be prioritized for cleaning or removal to prevent danger.

Among the objects, the split mug on the floor represents a hazard that should be prioritized for cleaning or removal according to Norm 6 and Norm 7.

According to Norm 7 and Norm 6, hazards should be prioritized for cleaning or picking up.

pen on the floor,"The command ""pick it up"" is given by Jordan to Taylor in the living room where multiple objects are on the floor: a pen, a book, a lamp, and a laptop. Among these, the pen is the smallest and most likely object to be referred to simply as ""it"" in a casual context. The plant is on the table, so it is not the target. Since the instruction is to pick something up, it is reasonable to choose an object that is on the floor and easy to pick up. The pen fits this description best. There is no indication of hazards or dirtiness, so the simplest interpretation is that Taylor is being asked to pick up the pen on the floor."
dirty plate,"In a tidying task in a library, the priority is to remove dirty items from the floor over other objects like books or lamps. The dirty plate on the floor represents a dirty item and a potential hazard, so it should be picked up first.

Among the objects, there are multiple rags in use and one rag that is not in use. The referring expression ""the rag"" most likely refers to the clean rag that is not in use, as it is appropriate for cleaning and available to be handed over."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are multiple spray bottles in use, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one that is not in use, as it is available and suitable for cleaning without interrupting ongoing use."
broom in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is asking for the broom, it implies the broom is the tool needed for cleaning. There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in use"" and the other is not. The referring expression is ""the broom,"" which likely refers to the broom currently in use, as it is the relevant tool for the cleaning task. Therefore, the broom in use is the object being referred to."
clean rag,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items (rags) rather than those currently in use. There are three rags: two are marked ""in_use"" and one is not. The rag not marked ""in_use"" is the clean rag, which is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
broom,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags: some are in use and one is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used."
spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spray bottle."" There are three spray bottles: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets, one simply labeled ""bucket"" and two labeled ""bucket in use."" Since Alex is currently cleaning and likely using a bucket, the request is for the bucket that is actively in use. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks involve using items that are not currently being used by others unless necessary, but here Alex is the one cleaning and presumably using the bucket. Therefore, the bucket in use is the correct object to hand over."
bucket not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger (Norm 7). Since there are multiple buckets, some in use and some not, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one not currently in use to avoid interfering with others' tasks and to comply with the norms."
mop not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Taylor should hand over the mop that is not in use to Jordan."
spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Riley should hand Morgan the spray bottle that is not in use, i.e., the clean and available spray bottle."
broom in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. However, since Cameron is asking for the broom, it implies the broom is the tool needed for cleaning. Among the brooms present, two are marked as ""in use"" and one is not. Given the request is for ""the broom"" and the presence of multiple brooms, the most relevant and likely intended object is the broom currently in use by Charlie, as it is the one Charlie can hand over. The other broom is not specified as in use and may not be accessible. Therefore, the ""broom in use"" is the correct object to refer to."
rag not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are multiple mops in use, but the request is for ""the mop,"" which implies the mop that is not currently in use. Therefore, the mop that is not in use (obj1) is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Among the spray bottles, some are in use and one is not. The spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is not currently being used and is suitable for cleaning purposes."
bucket not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are multiple buckets, some are marked as ""in use"" and some are not. Taylor should hand over the bucket that is not currently in use to avoid interfering with others' tasks and to comply with the cleaning norms."
rag,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean rags that are not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are three rags: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and presumably clean. Therefore, the rag without the ""in_use"" property is the correct target."
bucket not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others. Since two buckets are marked as ""in_use,"" they should not be taken. The only remaining bucket is the one not in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3 and Norm 1, for cleaning tasks, tools should be clean and usable. There are multiple mops, but two are marked as ""in use,"" so they are currently being used and should not be taken (Norm 5). The mop without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. However, since Casey is asking for the broom, and the broom is marked as ""in use,"" it indicates that this specific broom is the one intended for cleaning. The other broom is not specified as in use. Therefore, the ""broom in use"" is the correct object to refer to in this context."
spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Among the spray bottles, some are marked as ""in_use"" and some are not. The spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is not currently being used and is suitable for cleaning tasks."
broom,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean. There are multiple brooms, but two are in use, so they are not available. The only broom not marked as in use is the clean broom (obj3). Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is in use and one is not. Since Cameron is currently cleaning and likely using the bucket, the bucket in use is the relevant object to hand over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not touching items in use unless necessary, but here Cameron is the one using it and asking for it, so the bucket in use is the correct object to refer to."
the mop that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use (property in_use) and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
the bucket in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is just a bucket, and the other is a bucket marked as ""in_use."" Since Casey is cleaning and requests the bucket, it is most logical that they want the bucket currently in use for cleaning purposes. Norm 2 and Norm 5 do not conflict here because the bucket is not being used by someone else in a way that prevents handing it over; rather, it is the bucket intended for cleaning. Therefore, the bucket in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in use,"" so those should not be used. The appropriate object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the broom,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are marked as ""in_use"" by Taylor, and one is just a spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Jordan should be handed the spray bottle that is not currently in use by Taylor."
mop not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two mops in use and one mop not in use. Since Casey is asking for the mop to use, the mop not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and available for use without interfering with others."
clean broom,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the broom."" There are multiple brooms: some are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. Also, Norm 2 and 7 emphasize cleaning dirty items and hazards, but here the request is simply for the broom, so the clean, unused broom is the correct choice."
rag in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one rag is simply ""rag,"" and two rags are marked as ""in_use."" Since Jordan is cleaning and needs a rag to clean, the most relevant rag is the one currently in use, as it is likely the one being actively used for cleaning. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. However, here Jordan is requesting the rag to continue cleaning, so the rag in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
the mop not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not touch items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Charlie should hand over the mop that is not in use."
broom not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom, the appropriate object to hand over is a broom that is not currently in use. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, so the broom that is in use should not be handed over. Therefore, the broom that is free and not in use is the correct object to refer to."
broom not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two brooms, one in use and one not in use, Jordan is referring to the broom that is not in use to avoid interfering with Taylor's current use of the other broom."
bucket not in use,"In the cleaning task, Alex asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. There are multiple buckets, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one that is not in use."
the broom that is in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Jordan is cleaning and requests the broom, it is most logical that they want the broom currently being used or intended for use, which is the broom marked ""in_use."" This aligns with Norm 2 (cleaning task involves using tools that are clean and in use) and avoids handing over an unused broom."
mop not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two mops in use (obj1 and obj2) and one mop not in use (obj4). Since the mops in use are currently being used by someone, Morgan should be handed the mop that is not in use to avoid interfering with others and to follow the cleaning task norms."
mop in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since the task is cleaning and the mop ""in_use"" is likely the one currently being used for cleaning, it is the appropriate object to hand over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks should avoid items currently in use by someone else, but here Casey is requesting the mop, implying it is acceptable to hand over the mop in use. The other mop is not specified as in use, but the referring expression ""the mop"" likely refers to the mop currently in use for cleaning."
broom not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" so they are currently being used by someone. The remaining broom (obj6) is not in use and is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one mop is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Charlie should hand over the broom that is not in use."
the bucket that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since there are two buckets, one or both marked as ""in use,"" the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one that is not currently in use. This respects the norm of not interfering with items in use while facilitating the cleaning task."
mop not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the agent should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are two mops: one in use and one not in use. The mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used, aligning with the norms for cleaning tasks."
the broom that is in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Jordan is cleaning and requests the broom, it is most logical that they want the broom currently being used or intended for use in the cleaning task. The broom marked ""in_use"" is the one actively involved in the cleaning, so Taylor should hand over that broom."
the spray bottle that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two spray bottles, one is in use by Skyler and the other is not. Casey should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use to avoid interfering with Skyler's current use and to comply with the cleaning task norms."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. There is a bucket that is currently in use, which means it is the one Bailey is next to and likely the one Alex needs. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the bucket is being handed over for use, not cleaned. Therefore, the bucket in use is the correct object to refer to."
mop not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop, the mop that is currently not in use should be handed over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in a cleaning task, one should not take items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, the mop that is not in use (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items that are not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are multiple rags: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. Since the rag in use is likely being used by Riley or someone else, Morgan should be handed the rag that is not in use to avoid interfering with others and to have a clean tool for cleaning."
broom in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. Here, there are multiple brooms, but only some are marked as ""in use."" Since Casey is actively cleaning, the broom currently in use is the relevant object to hand over. Norm 5 also states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but handing over the broom in use is consistent with the request to assist in cleaning. Therefore, the ""broom in use"" is the correct object to refer to."
rag in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags, but only two are marked as ""in_use,"" indicating they are currently being used for cleaning. Since Cameron is actively cleaning, the rag in use is the most relevant and appropriate object to hand over, as it aligns with the cleaning task and the request for ""the rag."" The other rag is not in use and less likely to be the intended object."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and by extension, use clean tools. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not use items currently in use by someone else. There are two rags in use by Taylor, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The only other rag is clean and not in use, making it the suitable object to hand over."
the mop in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Alex is asking for the mop, it is likely the mop currently in use (obj3) is the one intended, as it is the active cleaning tool. The mop not in use (obj5) is less likely to be the target because the request is for the mop being used for cleaning. Therefore, the mop in use is the correct object to hand over."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bucket."" Among the objects, there are multiple buckets, some marked as ""in use."" Since the bucket is being requested for a cleaning task, it is logical to refer to a bucket that is currently in use (likely filled with water or cleaning solution) rather than an unused bucket. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks should avoid items not in use unless preventing danger, but here the bucket in use is the relevant tool for cleaning. Therefore, the ""bucket in use"" is the correct object being referred to."
broom,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one mop is in use and the other is not. Since Cameron is actively cleaning and requests the mop, it is most logical that they want the mop currently in use, as it is the tool being used for cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cleaning task, you should use clean tools, and the mop in use is presumably clean and ready for use. Therefore, the mop in use is the correct object to refer to."
rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two rags in use, but Morgan is requesting the rag, implying the rag that is not currently in use. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean rag,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is marked as ""in use"" and the other is not. Since Jordan is actively cleaning and requests the spray bottle, it is most logical that they want the spray bottle currently in use, as it is likely the one being used for cleaning. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Here, Jordan is requesting the spray bottle to continue cleaning, so the ""spray bottle in use"" is the appropriate object to hand over."
the mop that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. The Prolog code shows two mops: one is marked as in_use (obj1), and the other is not (obj3). Since Jordan is asking for the mop, it makes sense to hand over the mop that is not currently in use to avoid interrupting or taking an item someone else is using."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since there are two spray bottles, one is in use by Riley and the other is not. Morgan should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use to avoid interfering with Riley's use and to comply with the cleaning task norms."
the rag that is not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag, according to Norm 2, the rag should be clean and available for use. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not use items currently being used by someone else. There are two rags in use, so Bailey should hand over the rag that is not in use."
spray bottle not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are three spray bottles: two are marked as in use, and one is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. There are three spray bottles: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and not touch items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is asking for the spray bottle, it is most reasonable that they want the spray bottle that is not currently in use, as the ones in use are being handled by Riley or someone else. Therefore, the target object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
broom,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 3 and Norm 1, in a cleaning task, the tool used should be clean and not in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone and should not be handed over. The only broom without the ""in_use"" property is the clean broom (obj4). Therefore, the correct object to hand over is the clean broom that is not currently in use."
rag,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, the agent should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone else. There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. The rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for cleaning."
spray bottle not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one that is not in use."
spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. Since Cameron is asking for the spray bottle, it is logical to refer to the spray bottle that is not in use, as it is available and appropriate for the cleaning task."
broom,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). Among the brooms present, some are marked as ""in_use"" and some are not. The broom without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and clean for use in cleaning. Therefore, the target object is the broom that is not in use."
broom,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. The scene shows multiple brooms, some of which are in use. The referring expression is ""the broom,"" which likely refers to a broom that is not currently in use. Therefore, the appropriate object is the broom that is not marked as in use."
broom in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and not touch items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. However, since Casey is asking for the broom, and the broom is currently in use by Skyler, the most relevant object being referred to is the broom in use. The other items (bread, banana, apple) are not relevant to the cleaning task or the request."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. There are two brooms, both marked as ""in use,"" but the norm for cleaning tasks (Norm 5) states that you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the broom that is not in use (obj1) is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for the cleaning task."
the bucket in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since the bucket is in use, it is likely the one needed for cleaning. The referring expression ""the bucket"" most naturally refers to the bucket currently in use, as it is the relevant object for the cleaning task."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Casey is asking for a rag to use for cleaning, the appropriate rag is the one not currently in use. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the target object."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is ""in use"" and the other is not. Since Cameron is cleaning and requests the bucket, it is most logical that they want the bucket currently in use to continue the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning items that are dirty and not currently used by others, but here the bucket is in use by Charlie, who is the listener, so handing over the bucket in use is appropriate as it is the one being referred to as ""the bucket."""
rag not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. Since Cameron asks for ""the rag,"" it is most logical to refer to the rag that is not currently in use, as it is available and appropriate for cleaning."
bucket not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since there are two buckets marked as ""in_use"" and one bucket without that property, the bucket not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. This respects the norm of not interfering with items in use while still providing the needed tool for cleaning."
broom,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are multiple brooms: some are in use and some are not. The appropriate broom to hand over is the broom that is not in use, as it is available and suitable for cleaning. The throw pillow, magazine, and remote control are not relevant for cleaning with a broom."
the bucket that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. There are two buckets: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Riley should hand over the bucket that is not in use to avoid interfering with ongoing use and to comply with cleaning norms."
mop not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two mops, one in use and one not in use, the appropriate mop to hand over is the mop that is not currently in use. This respects the norm of not interfering with items in use while still providing the needed cleaning tool."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 applies: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or use tools that are clean. Also, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in use."" Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the mop that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple mops in use, but one mop is not in use. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used, aligning with the norms."
the bucket that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Taylor should hand Jordan the bucket that is not in use."
the broom that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two brooms, both marked as ""in_use,"" but the scene mentions a broom next to Riley and another broom in use. The broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used, aligning with the norms for cleaning tasks."
bucket in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket,"" the most appropriate bucket to hand over is one that is currently in use, as it is likely needed for the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning tasks should avoid items not in use unless preventing danger, but here the request is to hand over a bucket, so the bucket in use is the relevant object. The bucket not in use is less likely to be the intended object since the definite referring expression ""the bucket"" implies a specific, currently relevant bucket, which is the bucket in use."
spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are marked as ""in use,"" so they should not be used. The remaining spray bottle is not in use and is appropriate for the cleaning task. Therefore, the object referred to is the spray bottle that is not currently in use."
rag not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The only rag not marked as ""in_use"" is the one labeled simply as ""rag"" (obj5). Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the rag that is not in use."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are three spray bottles: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. Since Alex is asking for a spray bottle to use for cleaning, the appropriate choice is the spray bottle that is not currently in use, to avoid interfering with others and to follow the norms."
broom not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in use,"" so those should not be used. The clean, unused broom is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use. Among the brooms, some are in use and one is not. The broom without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for cleaning."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but one is specifically marked as ""in use,"" indicating it is currently being used for the cleaning task. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are clean and not currently being used by someone else unless necessary. Since Alex is cleaning and asking for the bucket, the ""bucket in use"" is the appropriate object to hand over because it is already involved in the cleaning process and likely clean and ready for use."
the broom that is not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. The broom in use should not be taken from Bailey, so the correct object to hand over is the broom that is not in use."
the bucket that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" Among the buckets present, some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. There is one bucket (obj7) without the ""in_use"" property, making it the appropriate object to hand over. This aligns with the norm that in a cleaning task, one should not touch items currently in use by someone else."
spray bottle (not in use),"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in_use"" and thus should not be used. The only spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property is obj3, which is the clean spray bottle. Therefore, the correct object to refer to is the spray bottle that is not in use."
clean mop,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mop."" There are three mops: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. This mop is clean and available, making it the correct choice."
the mop that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in_use"" and one mop is not in use. Jordan would refer to the mop that is available and not currently in use by Taylor or anyone else. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the correct object to hand over."
bucket,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are multiple buckets, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Since there are multiple mops, some in use and one not in use, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. The referring expression ""the mop"" likely refers to the mop that is available and not currently in use."
rag not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two rags in use and one rag not in use. Since the rag in use is currently being used by someone else, Casey should be handed the rag that is not in use to comply with the norms."
rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two rags, one is in use (property in_use) and the other is not. Jordan is requesting the rag, so the appropriate object is the rag that is not currently in use, as it is available for cleaning purposes."
mop not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two mops: one in use and one not in use. The mop in use is currently being used by Bailey, so Alex should be handed the mop that is not in use."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spray bottle."" There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the mop in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Alex is currently cleaning and likely using the mop marked ""in_use,"" the referring expression ""the mop"" most naturally refers to the mop currently in use. This aligns with the cleaning task context and the request to hand over the mop being used."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. The bucket is marked as ""in use,"" indicating it is currently being used, which aligns with the cleaning task. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the bucket is being handed over for cleaning purposes, so it is appropriate to use the bucket in use. The other objects like paintbrush, sandpaper, and paint can are not buckets and thus not relevant to the request."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is clean (obj2) and one is in use (obj4). According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and not touch items currently being used by someone else. Since the rag in use is currently being used by Taylor, Jordan should be handed the clean rag instead."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Since there are two spray bottles, one in use and one not, Morgan should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use to comply with the norms."
broom not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two brooms in use and one broom not in use. Since Casey is asking for the broom to use, the appropriate choice is the broom that is not currently in use, respecting Norm 5."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but two are marked as ""in use,"" indicating they are currently being used or ready for use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the mop, not clean it. The mop in use is the most relevant object to hand over for cleaning purposes. The other mop is not marked as in use, so the ""mop in use"" is the appropriate object to refer to."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are two rags in use (obj1 and obj5) and one rag not in use (obj4). Since the rag in use is likely being used by Taylor, Jordan should be handed the clean rag that is not in use to avoid interfering with Taylor's use and to comply with the cleaning task norms."
spray bottle,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the spray bottle."" There are three spray bottles: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the rag. There are two rags: one is in use by Charlie, and the other is presumably free. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean bucket,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here Casey is requesting a bucket, likely to assist with cleaning. There are multiple buckets: some are in use and one is not marked as in use. Norm 5 states not to touch items currently in use during cleaning, so the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate choice. Also, Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but no hazards are indicated here. Therefore, the clean, not in use bucket is the correct object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use by Taylor and the other is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Jordan should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use."
clean mop,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the tool used should be clean. There are two mops in use (obj2 and obj6) and one mop not in use (obj5). Since the mops in use are currently being used by someone (Skyler or others), Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, the mop that is not in use (obj5) is the appropriate object to hand over. This mop is clean and available, making it the correct choice."
rag not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one in use and one not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Skyler should hand over the broom that is not in use, respecting the cleaning task and avoiding interference with the broom currently in use."
broom in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. The scene shows multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in use,"" indicating they are currently being used or held. Since Morgan is cleaning and requests the broom, the most relevant object is the broom that is currently in use, as it is the one actively involved in the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not cleaning items in use, but here the request is to hand over the broom, so the broom in use is the correct object to refer to."
the mop that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone.

Since Casey wants the mop, the appropriate object to hand over is the mop that is not currently in use, as it is available and suitable for the cleaning task."
spray bottle not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spray bottle."" There are multiple spray bottles: two are in use (property in_use) and one is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used."
rag in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is asking for the rag, it implies the rag in use is the relevant cleaning tool. The rag in use is the one actively being used for cleaning, so it is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and use clean tools. Since two rags are marked as ""in_use,"" they are currently being used and should not be taken (Norm 5). The only rag not marked as in use is the clean rag (obj4). Therefore, the rag not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mop not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mop."" There are three mops: two are in use (properties include 'in_use'), and one mop is not in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and not currently being used by someone. Since the mop in use is currently being used, Bailey should hand over the clean mop that is not in use to Alex."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is just ""mop"" and the other is ""mop in use."" Since Alex is cleaning and presumably using the mop, the mop in use is the one relevant to the task. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the mop in use is the tool Alex is actively using for cleaning, so handing over the mop in use is appropriate. The mop without ""in use"" is presumably not being used and might not be the one Alex needs. Therefore, the mop in use is the correct object to hand over."
the bucket that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is in use, and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Skyler should hand over the bucket that is not in use, as it is appropriate and available for the cleaning task."
the bucket that is not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since there are two buckets in use and one bucket not in use, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one not currently in use, respecting the norm to avoid interfering with items in use."

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone.

spray bottle not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are three spray bottles: two are in use and one is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use, as it is available and safe to use for cleaning."
bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but only some are marked as ""in use."" Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely need the bucket currently in use for their task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning tasks involve using items that are not being used by others unless necessary, but here the bucket is in use and presumably belongs to Jordan or is needed for cleaning. Therefore, the bucket in use is the correct object to hand over."
mop,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. The mop is the appropriate cleaning tool to hand over. The mop in use is likely being used by Casey, so Skyler should hand the mop that is not in use. The referring expression ""the mop"" most naturally refers to the mop that is available for handing over, not the one in use."
the bucket not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. Since there are multiple buckets, and some are marked as ""in_use,"" the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one not currently in use. This respects the norm of not interfering with items in use while still providing the necessary tool for cleaning."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use by Riley and the other is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or take items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one that is not in use."
clean bucket,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, some are marked as ""in_use"" and some are not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not touch items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use should be handed over. This aligns with Norm 2 as well, since the bucket is a tool likely needed for cleaning and should be clean (not dirty or in use). Hence, the clean bucket (the one without the ""in_use"" property) is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are two spray bottles: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use, as it is available and suitable for the cleaning task."
rag in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags present: one is marked as ""in use"" and the other is not. Since Morgan is actively cleaning, the rag ""in use"" is the one currently being utilized for the cleaning task, making it the most relevant and appropriate object to hand over. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Here, the rag ""in use"" is the one needed for cleaning, so it is the correct object to refer to."
broom in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Skyler is next to the broom in use, and Casey is requesting the broom, it is most logical that the broom being referred to is the one currently in use. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the broom, not to clean it. Therefore, the broom in use is the relevant object."
bucket in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one simply labeled ""bucket"" and another labeled ""bucket in use."" Since the task is cleaning, and the bucket in use is likely the one currently being used for cleaning, Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest using the item that is actively in use for the cleaning task. Therefore, the ""bucket in use"" is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the broom."" There are multiple brooms, some are in use and some are not.

clean bucket,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is ""in_use"" and the other is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. Since the bucket ""in_use"" is likely being used by Riley, Morgan should be handed the other bucket that is not in use. Also, the bucket is not described as dirty or hazardous, so the clean bucket is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

spray bottle that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" so those are not appropriate to hand over. The correct object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Taylor should hand over the broom that is not in use."
bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one empty and one marked as ""in use."" Since Jordan is actively cleaning, the bucket ""in use"" is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is likely the one currently being used for cleaning tasks. The empty bucket is not in use and thus less relevant. Norm 2 and Norm 5 guide that in cleaning tasks, one should use items that are actively in use and avoid unnecessary handling of unused items."
the broom that is not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two brooms: one is in use (property in_use) and the other is not. Cameron should be handed the broom that is not in use to avoid interfering with the one currently being used."
mop that is not in use,"Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop, according to Norm 2, the mop should be clean and available for use. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not use items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in use."" Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple rags in use (obj2, obj5, obj6), so those are not appropriate to hand over. The only rag not in use is obj7, which is clean and available. Therefore, the rag that is not in use (clean rag) is the correct object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

bucket not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. The bucket that is in use (obj2) is currently being used, so it should not be handed over.

rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone.

Therefore, the rag is the correct object to refer to."
spray bottle,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone.

Since Cameron is asking for the spray bottle, it is most logical they want the spray bottle that is not currently in use by Charlie or anyone else, to avoid interfering with items in use. Therefore, the target object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
clean mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops: some are in use and some are not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and not touch items currently in use by someone else. Since the mops in use are currently being used, the mop that is not in use and presumably clean is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops in use and one mop that is not in use. Since the task is cleaning and the mop in use is the tool actively being used for cleaning, it makes sense that Casey refers to the mop in use to continue the cleaning task effectively. Norm 3 states that in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean and in use, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here Casey is requesting the mop to use it themselves, so the mop in use is the appropriate object."
bucket not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is marked as ""in use"" and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not touch items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Skyler should hand over the bucket that is not in use to Casey."
clean spray bottle,"The task is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, the agent should clean dirty items. However, the request is to hand over a spray bottle, which is a tool used for cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cleaning task, tools used for cleaning should be clean. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" so per Norm 5, they should not be touched. The remaining spray bottle is clean and not in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. The mop is the requested object and is not marked as in use, unlike the other mops. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
clean rag,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are three rags: two are in use (obj1 and obj6), and one is not in use (obj3). Since Cameron is asking for the rag to use for cleaning, the appropriate rag to hand over is the clean rag that is not currently in use (obj3). This avoids interfering with items in use and follows the cleaning task norms."
clean bucket,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are two buckets in use, which should not be used. Therefore, the bucket referred to is the clean bucket that is not in use."
broom,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. The broom is a cleaning tool and is appropriate for the cleaning task. Although one broom is in use, the referring expression ""the broom"" likely refers to the broom that Skyler is next to and can hand over. This aligns with Norm 2 (cleaning task involves cleaning items that are dirty or tools needed for cleaning) and Norm 5 (do not clean items in use, but here the broom is being handed, not cleaned). Therefore, the object referred to is the broom that Skyler can hand to Casey."
mop,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone else. Since there are two mops, one is in use and the other is not. Jordan requests ""the mop,"" which implies the mop that is not currently in use, as the in-use mop is likely being used by Taylor or someone else. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use (property in_use) and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Skyler should hand over the rag that is not in use."
clean rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are two rags in use (obj1 and obj6) and one rag not in use (obj5). Since Casey is asking for the rag to use for cleaning, the appropriate rag to hand over is the clean rag that is not currently in use."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone (Norm 5). There are three spray bottles: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. Casey should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use to avoid interfering with others and to follow the cleaning norms."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is marked as in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one not in use."
mop in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in use"" and the other is not. Since Cameron is currently cleaning and likely using the mop that is in use, the mop in use is the relevant object to hand over. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and not touch items currently being used by someone unless necessary. However, since Cameron is asking for the mop, it implies the mop in use is the intended object. The mop not in use is less relevant here."
the mop that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple mops in use, so the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
bucket in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean tools, but here the bucket is marked as ""in use,"" indicating it is currently being used by Charlie. However, since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand over the bucket, it implies that this is the relevant bucket for the cleaning task. The bucket is the only object that fits the description ""the bucket"" in the scene, and it is necessary for the cleaning task. Despite the bucket being in use, it is the only suitable object to refer to in this context."
the broom that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. Since Morgan is asking for the broom to use for cleaning, the appropriate object is the broom that is not in use, as it is available and not currently being used by someone else."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are not currently in use by someone else. There are three brooms: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for cleaning."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since there are two spray bottles, one in use by Taylor and one not in use, Jordan should be handed the spray bottle that is not currently in use to respect these norms."
mop,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. The mop is the appropriate cleaning tool to hand over. The mop in use is currently being used, so it is not suitable to hand over. The dirty pan is not a tool to hand over for cleaning but an item to be cleaned. Therefore, the mop (not in use) is the correct object to hand over."
the rag that is in use,"Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" Among the objects Taylor is next to, there are two rags: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Jordan is cleaning and requests the rag, it is most logical that they want the rag currently being used for cleaning, as it is the active cleaning tool. The rag that is in use is the appropriate object to hand over in this cleaning task."
mop in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but only one is currently in use. Since the task is cleaning and the mop in use is the one actively being used for cleaning, it makes sense that Casey refers to the mop in use to continue the cleaning task effectively. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not touching items in use unless necessary, but here Casey is the one cleaning and asking for the mop in use, indicating it is the correct object to refer to."
mop not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, Riley should hand over the mop that is not in use."

According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and not touch items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since the rags in use are currently being used by Riley, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two mops: one is just ""mop"" and the other is ""mop in use."" Since the mop in use is currently being used, it should not be handed over. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags: some are in use and one is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Riley should hand over the rag that is not currently in use, as it is the appropriate object to hand over without interrupting ongoing use."
broom,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the broom."" There are multiple brooms, but three are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The only broom not marked as in use is obj2, which is simply labeled as ""broom."" Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the clean, unused broom (obj2)."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items (not in use) and avoid items currently being used by someone (Norm 5). There are three spray bottles: two are in use and one is not. The appropriate choice is the spray bottle that is not in use."
rag not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags in the scene, but one is currently in use, and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning purposes."
broom not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are two brooms: one in use by Charlie and one not in use. Since the broom in use is currently being used by Charlie, Cameron should be handed the broom that is not in use."

the mop in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. The mop is currently in use, which means it is the one actively being used for cleaning. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use for cleaning. Since the mop is the cleaning tool currently in use, it is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are multiple brooms, some marked as ""in_use"" and one without that property. The broom not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used by someone else."
the bucket that is in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not. Since Jordan is cleaning and requests the bucket, it is most logical that they want the bucket currently in use (likely filled with water or cleaning supplies) rather than a spare bucket. This aligns with Norm 2 (cleaning task involves using relevant tools) and the fact that the bucket in use is the one actively being used for cleaning."
broom,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the broom. The broom is a cleaning tool and is appropriate for the cleaning task. Although one broom is marked as ""in_use,"" the referring expression ""the broom"" likely refers to the broom that Skyler is next to and not currently in use. Therefore, the correct object to hand over is the broom that is not in use."
broom,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean tools. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" so they are currently being used and should not be touched (Norm 5). The remaining broom is not in use and is therefore the appropriate object to hand over."
mop in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use tools that are clean. However, the only mops available are marked as ""in use,"" indicating they are currently being used by someone. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand over the mop, not to clean it. Since the mop is needed for cleaning and the only mops present are ""in use,"" the most appropriate object to refer to is the ""mop in use"" that Riley can hand over to Morgan."
bucket not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but three are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently in use."
broom not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one in use and one not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Riley should hand Morgan the broom that is not in use."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since one spray bottle is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the mop that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two mops in use and one mop not in use, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. This respects the norms by avoiding interference with items currently in use while still providing a tool for cleaning."
broom in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use (obj1) and one is not specified as in use (obj5).

According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Jordan is asking for the broom, implying it is the one in use and the intended object.

broom,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. The other objects like the rolling pin, grater, and dirty pan are not relevant to the request for ""the broom."" Hence, the correct object is the broom that is not in use."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid items currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are multiple rags, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" so they should not be used. The rag without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over."
the rag that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the rag. There are two rags: one is in use by Bailey, and the other is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Bailey should hand over the rag that is not in use to Alex."

There is one broom (obj6) that is not marked as in use, making it the suitable object to hand over for cleaning purposes."
broom,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use (property in_use) and the other is not.

rag in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags, but one is specifically marked as ""in use,"" indicating it is the rag currently being used for cleaning.

bucket not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

Morgan would refer to the rag that is not currently in use to avoid interfering with Riley's use of the other rags."
spray bottle (not in use),"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items, and Norm 5 states not to use items currently in use by someone else.

Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger, but here the request is to hand over the bucket, not to clean it. Since Cameron is cleaning and likely needs the bucket they are currently using, the most relevant object is the ""bucket in use."" The non-in-use bucket is less likely to be the one needed. Therefore, the ""bucket in use"" is the correct referent."
rag,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag. There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
the mop not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two mops in use (obj1 and obj4), so these are not appropriate to hand over. The mop that is not in use (obj6) is the suitable object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used, aligning with the norms."
bucket,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. Since the task is cleaning, Morgan needs the bucket to assist with cleaning activities. The bucket is the relevant object here, and although one bucket is in use, the referring expression ""the bucket"" likely refers to the bucket that Riley can hand over. The bucket is a cleaning tool, so it aligns with the cleaning task norm."
rag not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are two rags in use and one rag not in use. Since the rags in use are currently being used by someone, Taylor should hand over the rag that is not in use to Jordan."
clean broom,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the broom."" There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Charlie should hand over the clean broom that is not in use."
the rag that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the rag. There are two rags: one is in use by Riley and the other is not in use.

Since the mop is the cleaning tool and is in use, it is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one mop in use and one mop not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is asking for the mop to continue cleaning, the mop in use is the relevant object to hand over. The mop in use is the one actively being used for cleaning, so it is the appropriate object to refer to in this context."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use dirty items that need cleaning, but here the request is for a rag to clean with, so it should be a clean rag. Norm 5 states not to use items currently in use by someone else, and several rags are marked as ""in_use,"" so those are excluded. The only rag not marked as in use is obj6, which is a clean rag. Therefore, the appropriate object is the clean rag that is not currently in use."
clean rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags: some are in use and some are not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid touching items currently in use by others. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use cleaning tools that are not currently in use by someone else. There are three spray bottles: two are marked as in use, and one is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not currently in use."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mop."" There are multiple mops, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The other mop (obj4) is not in use, so it is the appropriate object to hand over. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the correct target object."
spray bottle not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use by Skyler, and the other is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Casey should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use."
clean mop,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the mop."" There are two mops in use and one mop that is not in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty but not those currently in use by someone else. Since the mops in use are currently being used, the mop that is not in use (and presumably clean) is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple rags, but several are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. The only rag not marked as ""in_use"" is the clean rag that Charlie can hand over. Therefore, the appropriate object to refer to is the rag that is not in use."
mop in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Alex is cleaning and presumably using the mop, the mop ""in_use"" is the one being referred to. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Alex is asking for the mop, so the mop in use is the relevant object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. Since Cameron is asking for the rag, it makes sense to hand over the rag that is not currently in use to avoid interrupting others and to follow the norms."
the spray bottle that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not.

According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. The mop that is not in use is the clean mop (obj2), as the others are marked as in use. Hence, the clean mop is the correct target object."
spray bottle not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use (Norm 5). There are two spray bottles: one is marked as in_use and the other is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use, as it is available and suitable for cleaning."
bucket not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are multiple buckets, some are marked as ""in use"" and some are not. The appropriate bucket to hand over is the one that is not in use, as it is available and safe to use without interfering with others."
broom not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else.

broom,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or needed for cleaning. The broom is a cleaning tool and is appropriate for the cleaning task. Although there are brooms in use, the referring expression ""the broom"" likely refers to the available broom that is not currently in use, making it the suitable object to hand over."
the mop that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

spray bottle not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

Since Cameron is asking for the spray bottle, it should be the one not currently in use to avoid interfering with Charlie's use of the other spray bottles. Therefore, the appropriate object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. Among the objects, there are multiple mops, some marked as ""in_use."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. However, since Alex is asking for the mop, it implies the mop is the tool needed for cleaning. The mop marked as ""in_use"" is likely the one currently being used or intended for use, so handing over the ""mop in use"" is appropriate for the cleaning task."

rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone.

the mop in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use by Taylor, and the other is presumably not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the spray bottle."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools that are not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are multiple spray bottles: obj1 and obj6 are in use, obj2 is an empty spray bottle, and obj5 is a spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property. The empty spray bottle (obj2) is not useful for cleaning, and the spray bottles in use (obj1 and obj6) should not be taken from someone else. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use and not empty (obj5). This matches the referring expression ""the spray bottle."""
bucket not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

Therefore, the target object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
bucket,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean tools and avoid touching items in use unless preventing danger. The bucket is currently in use by Riley, but since Morgan is requesting it, it implies the bucket is needed for cleaning. The bucket is the only relevant object fitting the description ""the bucket"" and is the appropriate tool for cleaning."
the bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is just a bucket, and the other is a bucket in use. Since Cameron is cleaning and requests the bucket, it is most logical that they want the bucket currently in use for cleaning purposes.

broom,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

The empty spray bottle is not useful for cleaning, and the spray bottles in use are currently being used by someone else, so they should not be touched (Norm 5). Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use and not empty."
bucket not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

bucket,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use. The bucket is the relevant cleaning tool here. Although there are multiple buckets, some are marked as in use, so the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over.

mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and one is not. Since Cameron is cleaning and likely using the mop currently in use, the referring expression ""the mop"" most naturally refers to the mop that is in use, as it is the one actively involved in the cleaning task."
clean rag,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else.

rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. The other objects (plant, lamp, book) are not rags and thus not relevant. Hence, the rag that is not in use is the correct target object."

There are multiple rags, some in use and one that is not in use and not dirty. Norm 5 states not to use items currently in use by someone else, so the rag that is not in use is the appropriate choice. Therefore, the clean rag that is not in use is the correct object to hand over."
mop,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one mop is in use (property in_use), and the other mop is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Alex should be handed the mop that is not in use, as it is the appropriate tool for cleaning and is available."

rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Since Casey is asking for ""the rag"" and there are multiple rags, some in use and one not in use, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use. This respects the norm of not taking items currently in use by others during cleaning."
spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. There are three spray bottles: two are in use (obj1 and obj6), and one (obj4) is not in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Alex is asking for the spray bottle to use for cleaning, the appropriate object is the spray bottle that is not in use (obj4). Therefore, the target object is the spray bottle that is not currently in use."
bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are multiple buckets, but only some are marked as ""in use."" Since the task is cleaning, and the bucket is being used (likely containing cleaning supplies or water), it makes sense Jordan wants the bucket currently in use rather than an empty or unused bucket. This aligns with Norm 2 (cleaning task involves using appropriate items) and Norm 5 (avoid touching items not in use unless necessary). The ""bucket in use"" is the relevant object Jordan is referring to."
the mop that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Skyler should hand over the mop that is not in use to Casey."
spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use. There are three spray bottles: one in use (obj2), one not marked as in use (obj5), and one in use (obj6). Since Cameron asks for ""the spray bottle"" and Norm 5 advises against using items in use, the appropriate object is the spray bottle that is not in use (obj5)."
mop not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid touching items currently in use by others. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
the mop that is not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not.

rag not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags, but one is in use by Taylor, and according to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket in use,"Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket,"" and there are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. Since the task is cleaning and the bucket that is in use is the one likely needed for cleaning, the bucket in use is the correct object to hand over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 imply not to interfere with items not in use unless necessary, but here the bucket in use is the one relevant to the cleaning task."
rag not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Bailey should hand over the rag that is not in use to Alex for cleaning purposes."
broom in use,"Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the broom."" There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in use"" and the other is not. Since Riley is next to the paint can and is currently using a broom (the one marked ""in_use""), it is most logical that Morgan is referring to the broom currently being used by Riley. In a cleaning task, the broom that is in use is the relevant tool to hand over."
clean rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items (rags) rather than those in use or dirty. There are multiple rags, some in use and some not. Morgan would want the clean rag that is not currently in use to effectively clean. Therefore, the rag that is not marked as ""in_use"" is the appropriate object to hand over."
the broom that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Skyler should hand over the broom that is not in use."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags: some are in use and one is not.

Since Jordan is asking for the rag, it is most logical that they want the clean rag that is not currently in use, to avoid interfering with Taylor's use of the other rags. Therefore, the target object is the clean rag that is not in use."
clean spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. The spray bottle that is ""in_use"" is likely being used by Skyler, so Casey should be handed the other spray bottle that is not in use and presumably clean. Therefore, the correct object is the clean spray bottle that is not currently in use."
bucket,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid using items that are currently in use by someone else. There are multiple buckets, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" so they should not be used. The remaining bucket is not in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over."
broom not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two brooms in use (obj2 and obj4), so the broom that is not in use (obj5) is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are not currently in use by someone else. There are two mops: one in use and one not in use. The mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for cleaning."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two spray bottles in use and one spray bottle not in use. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the bucket that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple buckets, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" so they should not be touched. The bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and safe to use without interfering with others."
spray bottle (not in use),"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" so they should not be touched. The spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for the cleaning task."
clean rag not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are multiple rags, but three are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched. The only rag not marked as in use is the clean rag (obj6). Therefore, the rag that Bailey should hand to Alex is the clean rag that is not in use."
the bucket that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Among the buckets present, some are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The appropriate bucket to hand over is the one that is not in use, as it is available and safe to use without interfering with others."

broom,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. The broom is the appropriate object to use for cleaning, and it is not decorative or in conflict with any norms. Although there is a broom in use, the referring expression ""the broom"" likely refers to the broom that Charlie is next to and can hand over. This aligns with Norm 2 (clean items that are dirty) and Norm 5 (do not clean items in use unless preventing danger), but here the broom is a tool for cleaning, so handing it over is appropriate."
bucket,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two buckets in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The only other bucket is not marked as in use, so it is the suitable object to hand over for cleaning purposes."
clean mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The mop without the ""in_use"" property is the clean mop that is free to be handed over. Therefore, the appropriate object to refer to is the clean mop that is not currently in use."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are multiple spray bottles in use, Morgan would want the spray bottle that is not currently in use to avoid interrupting Riley or others. Therefore, the appropriate object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
mop in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. The mop is currently in use by Riley, which means it is the relevant cleaning tool at the moment. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Morgan is requesting the mop from Riley, so the mop in use is the correct object to refer to and hand over."
the rag that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Bailey should hand over the rag that is not in use to Alex."
clean rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, so the rags in use are likely unavailable. Norm 2 and 3 imply using clean tools for cleaning. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, some marked as ""in_use"" and some not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not touch items currently being used by someone else.

Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. Since Cameron is cleaning and needs the broom they are currently using, the ""broom in use"" is the relevant object. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Cameron is requesting the broom they are using, so the ""broom in use"" is the correct object to hand over."
broom in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since the broom is in use and is the cleaning tool requested, the correct object is the broom in use."
the bucket that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets: some are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not.

Therefore, Riley should hand Morgan the bucket that is not in use, as it is appropriate for cleaning and not currently occupied."
clean mop,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The mop that is not in use is the clean mop that Riley can hand over. Therefore, the object referred to is the clean mop that is not currently in use."
bucket not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets: some are in use and one is not marked as in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not use or clean items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one that is not currently in use."
mop in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" indicating they are currently being used or ready for use. Since Cameron is actively cleaning and requests the mop, the most relevant object is the ""mop in use"" rather than a mop that is not in use. This aligns with Norm 3, which states that in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean and ready. The ""mop in use"" is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. The mop is currently in use by Taylor, which means it is the relevant and available cleaning tool. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the tool should be clean, and since the mop is in use, it is presumably clean and ready for cleaning. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here Jordan is asking to be handed the mop, not to clean it, so it is appropriate to refer to the mop in use."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone else. There are three rags: two are in use (obj2 and obj5), and one is not in use (obj3).

Therefore, the mop without the ""in_use"" property is the correct object to hand over."
the mop that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. There are three mops: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used by Taylor or anyone else."
the rag not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid using items currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are three rags: two are in use and one is not.

spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Therefore, Bailey should hand over the spray bottle that is not in use, which is the clean and available spray bottle (obj1). This aligns with the cleaning task and respects the norms."
broom in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is asking for the broom, it implies the broom in use is the one intended.

Since the broom is the object being referred to and is relevant to the cleaning task, the correct object is the broom."
bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. The bucket is currently in use and is the relevant cleaning tool available. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are appropriate for cleaning and not interfere with items in use unless necessary.

Since Alex is cleaning and Bailey is next to the spray bottle in use, the most relevant and accessible object to hand over is the spray bottle that is currently in use. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning tasks should avoid touching items in use unless necessary, but here Alex explicitly asks for the spray bottle, indicating permission. Therefore, the spray bottle in use is the correct object to refer to."
bucket in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Alex is cleaning and likely needs the bucket currently in use for cleaning tasks, the appropriate object to hand over is the bucket that is in use. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in cleaning tasks, one should not touch items currently in use by someone else unless necessary, but since Alex is requesting it, it is appropriate. The bucket not in use is likely not the one being referred to as ""the bucket"" in this context."

According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking Charlie to hand them the broom, the most logical object is the broom currently in use by Charlie, as Charlie is next to it and can hand it over. The broom not in use is less likely because Cameron specifically asks Charlie, who is next to the broom in use. Therefore, the referred object is the broom in use by Charlie."

spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid using items that are currently in use by someone else. Among the spray bottles, some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched.

There are two rags: one is in use (property in_use) and the other is not. The rag in use should not be touched, so the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. This rag is presumably clean and ready for use."
mop not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and not currently being used by someone else. Since the mop in use is currently being used, Bailey should hand over the mop that is not in use."
broom not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as in use, so the appropriate broom to hand over is the one not in use. This ensures the cleaning task proceeds without interfering with items currently being used."
bucket in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets in use near Riley, and since the task is cleaning, the bucket that is currently in use is the relevant and appropriate object to hand over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks involve using items that are in use and avoiding items not related to the task. The bucket in use is the suitable object for the cleaning task."
the rag that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Since there are two rags in use and one rag not in use, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use. This respects the norm of not interfering with items currently being used."
mop,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. The mop is a cleaning tool and is appropriate for the cleaning task. The mop is not decorative and is the relevant object for the request. Although there are multiple mops, the referring expression ""the mop"" indicates a specific mop, so the mop is the correct object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the spray bottle."" There are three spray bottles: two are marked as ""in use,"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one that is not in use."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" Among the buckets present, some are marked as ""in_use."" According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but since Alex is asking for the bucket, it implies the bucket in use is the relevant object for the cleaning task. The bucket without ""in_use"" property is likely not the one being referred to, as the definite article ""the bucket"" suggests a specific, currently relevant bucket, which is one of the buckets in use."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the broom. There are multiple brooms, some marked as ""in use"" and one simply as ""broom"" without ""in use."" According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate broom to hand over is the broom that is not in use."
bucket in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. Since there are multiple buckets, the referring expression ""the bucket"" likely refers to the bucket currently in use, as it is the relevant and active tool for the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks should use appropriate tools, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but here the bucket in use is the practical object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items (not empty or in use). The scene shows multiple spray bottles, some in use and one empty. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not currently in use and not empty, as it is ready for use in cleaning."
broom not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are three brooms: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The broom not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used by anyone."
rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the spray bottle."" There are three spray bottles: two are in use (obj1 and obj5), and one (obj3) is not in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not touch items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use (obj3) is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mop,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops: two are in use and one is not in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not take items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. Since the mop is not described as dirty or broken, it is considered clean and suitable for use."
broom not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the appropriate broom to hand over is the one broom that is not in use."
spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use. There are two spray bottles: one is in use (obj3) and the other is not (obj1). The spray bottle in use should not be touched, so the appropriate object to hand over is the clean, unused spray bottle (obj1)."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use, as the one in use is currently being used by someone and should not be touched."
clean rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by someone else. Since the rags in use are currently being used, the appropriate rag to hand over is the clean rag that is not in use."
rag in use,"Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag,"" and there are two rags: one is in use and one is not. Since Skyler is next to the rag that is in use, it is most natural and practical for Skyler to hand over the rag currently in use. Also, in a cleaning task, the rag is the appropriate tool to be handed over, and the rag in use is likely the one intended."
broom in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else unless it is to prevent danger. Here, there are two brooms marked as ""in use"" and one broom not marked as in use. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the broom, and Riley is next to the broom in use, it is most logical that the referred object is the broom in use that Riley is next to, as it is the one accessible to Riley to hand over."
the rag in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use unless preventing danger. However, since Cameron specifically asks for ""the rag,"" and there are two rags—one in use and one not—the referring expression ""the rag"" likely points to the rag currently in use, as it is the one Cameron needs to continue cleaning. The rag in use is the relevant object for the cleaning task."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are two mops in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The mop that is not in use is the correct object to hand over, as it is clean and available for use in cleaning."
clean rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two rags in use, so they are not appropriate to hand over. The request is for ""the rag,"" which implies a clean rag not currently in use. Therefore, the clean rag is the correct object to hand over."
broom,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are three brooms: two are in use and one is not. The broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for cleaning."
rag not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use by Taylor, and the other is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use."
the bucket that is not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since there are two buckets, one marked as ""in_use"" and one not, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one not currently in use by Bailey. This respects the norm of not interfering with items in use while facilitating the cleaning task."
bucket in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but only some are marked as ""in use."" Since Alex is actively cleaning, the bucket in use is the relevant and appropriate object to hand over, as it is the one currently being utilized for the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks should focus on relevant items in use, and Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but here the bucket in use is the practical choice for the cleaning activity."
spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools (Norm 3) and avoid using items currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). Among the spray bottles present, some are marked as ""in_use,"" which should be avoided. Therefore, the appropriate object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or useful for cleaning. The spray bottle is a cleaning tool and is appropriate for the task. Although one spray bottle is in use by Charlie, the other spray bottle is free and can be handed over. Therefore, the object referred to is the spray bottle that is not in use."
mop not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are multiple mops: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. Since Alex is cleaning and wants the mop, the appropriate object to hand over is the mop that is not currently in use by anyone, to avoid interfering with others and to follow the norms."
the broom that is not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since the broom in use is likely being used by Charlie or someone else, Cameron should be handed the broom that is not in use to avoid interfering and to comply with the cleaning task norms."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them ""the broom."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are multiple brooms, some in use and one not in use. Since the brooms in use are currently being used by Taylor, Jordan should be handed the broom that is not in use to respect Norm 5."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is just a bucket, and the other is a bucket in use. Since Cameron is cleaning and likely needs the bucket currently in use for cleaning purposes, the appropriate object to hand over is the ""bucket in use."" This aligns with Norm 2 (cleaning task involves dirty items or tools in use) and Norm 5 (avoid touching items not in use unless preventing danger), but here the bucket in use is the relevant cleaning tool."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the broom."" According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms, some in use and some not. Bailey is next to several brooms, some in use and some not. Since Alex is cleaning and requests the broom, the appropriate object to hand over is a broom that is not currently in use, to avoid interfering with others' work and to comply with the norms."
broom not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are multiple brooms, some in use and some not. Since the broom in use is currently being used by Bailey, Alex should be handed the broom that is not in use to avoid conflict and follow the norms."
mop in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. The Prolog code indicates there is a mop that is currently in use. Since Morgan is cleaning, they need the mop that is actively being used for the cleaning task. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and appropriate for cleaning. The mop in use is the relevant object here, as it is the cleaning tool currently being utilized."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate broom to hand over is the one broom that is not marked as ""in_use."" This aligns with the norms for cleaning tasks and respects the current usage of objects."
bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but only one is marked as ""in use,"" which implies it is the one currently being used for cleaning. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are clean and not currently being used by someone else unless it is necessary. Since Jordan is asking for the bucket, it is logical that they want the bucket currently in use for cleaning, not a clean or decorative bucket. Therefore, the ""bucket in use"" is the correct object being referred to."
spray bottle not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. Among the spray bottles, some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by Charlie or others. The only spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property is the one that is free to be handed over. Therefore, the correct object to refer to is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the bucket that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not.

rag in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. Since the task is cleaning and the rag in use is likely the one currently being used for cleaning, it makes sense to refer to the rag in use. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. However, here the rag is being requested to be handed over, implying it is the tool for cleaning. The rag in use is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
the mop that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and not touch items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger.

Therefore, the bucket not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one mop is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and not currently being used by someone.

bucket in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since the bucket is in use by Charlie, it is the object being referred to and requested to be handed over. The dirty pan is dirty but not requested, and the bucket is the specific object mentioned in the referring expression."
mop,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the tool used should be clean and available. There are two mops in use, which are currently being used and thus not available (Norm 5). The other mop is not marked as in use, so it is the appropriate object to hand over. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the correct object to refer to."

broom in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. Since Jordan is cleaning and likely using the broom, the request is for the broom currently in use.

bucket in use,"Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is marked as ""in use"" and the other is not. Since the request uses the definite article ""the,"" it likely refers to the bucket currently in use, as it is more specific and identifiable. Also, in a cleaning task, the bucket is a relevant tool, and the one in use is the one likely needed."
mop,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone.

bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. Since the task is cleaning and the bucket in use is currently being used by Taylor, the bucket Jordan refers to is the one Taylor is next to and using.

The rag is a cleaning tool and is the object being referred to.

the bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not. Since Jordan is cleaning and likely needs the bucket currently in use for cleaning purposes, the referring expression ""the bucket"" most naturally refers to the bucket that is in use. This aligns with Norm 2 (cleaning task involves using relevant items) and Norm 5 (avoid touching items not in use unless preventing danger), so the bucket in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not. Since the bucket in use is the one currently being used by Skyler (listener), and Casey is asking for ""the bucket,"" it is most logical that Casey wants the bucket that is currently in use for cleaning purposes. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Casey is asking to be handed the bucket, not to clean it. Therefore, the bucket in use is the correct object to refer to."
the bucket that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. There are three spray bottles: one in use by Skyler (obj2), one not in use (obj4), and another in use (obj6). According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should use clean tools and not take items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. The spray bottle not in use (obj4) is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and available."
spray bottle,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which implies they are currently being used by someone (Taylor or others). Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use, but here the request is to hand the broom, not to clean it, so the broom in use is the correct object."
the bucket that is in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. Since the task is cleaning, the bucket is a relevant tool. The Prolog code shows two buckets marked as ""in_use,"" indicating they are currently being used. Given the request is specifically for ""the bucket,"" it is most logical that Morgan refers to the bucket currently in use, as it is the appropriate cleaning tool needed for the task."

According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. However, since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand over the spray bottle, it implies the spray bottle in use is the one being referred to.

spray bottle (not in use),"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should not use items that are currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are three spray bottles: two are in use (obj1 and obj6), and one is not in use (obj3). Therefore, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one that is not in use."

Therefore, the only suitable spray bottle to hand over is the clean, unused spray bottle (obj2). Hence, the referred object is the clean spray bottle."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the broom."" There are three brooms: one is in use (property in_use), and two are not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Bailey should hand over a broom that is not currently in use.

clean bucket,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid using items that are currently in use by someone else. There are two buckets marked as ""in_use,"" so these are not appropriate. The only other bucket is clean and not in use, so the ""clean bucket"" is the correct object to hand over."
mop not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone else.

The mop in use is the object Casey wants to be handed for cleaning purposes."
the broom that is not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else.

bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not.

mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is just ""mop"" and the other is ""mop in use."" Since the mop in use is currently being used, Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the mop, not to clean it. The mop in use is the one Taylor is next to and presumably the one Jordan wants. The mop without ""in use"" is not specified as being near Taylor. Therefore, the mop in use is the correct object to hand over for the cleaning task."
spray bottle (not in use),"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should use clean items and avoid touching items currently in use by others. There are three spray bottles: two are in use, and one is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use, as it is clean and available for use without interfering with others."
the bucket that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two buckets, one is in use by Riley and the other is not. Morgan should be handed the bucket that is not in use to avoid interfering with Riley's use and to comply with the cleaning task norms."
clean spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is clean and the other is in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should use clean items and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the clean spray bottle, not the one in use."
rag,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, the relevant norm is that in a cleaning task, one should use clean and available tools. There are two spray bottles: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone. Since there are two rags, one in use and one not, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use."
rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since there are two mops in use and one mop not in use, the mop not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mop,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. Also, the mop is a cleaning tool, so it fits the cleaning task context."
the bucket that is not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are three buckets: two are in use, and one is not. The bucket not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used, aligning with the norms."
bucket in use,"Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket,"" and there are multiple buckets present. Since Alex is cleaning and the task is cleaning, the bucket that is currently in use (marked as ""in_use"") is the most relevant and appropriate object to hand over. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the bucket, not to clean it. The bucket in use is the one actively involved in the cleaning task, so it makes sense to refer to and hand over that specific bucket."
spray bottle,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. Since there are two spray bottles, one is in use and the other is not. Jordan is likely referring to the spray bottle that is not in use to avoid interfering with Taylor's current use. Therefore, the appropriate object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
mop not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mop."" There are multiple mops, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the mop that is not in use (obj6) is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. The bucket is currently in use, which means it is the relevant cleaning tool needed. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the bucket is being requested for use, so it is appropriate to hand over the bucket in use."
rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are dirty or needed for cleaning. The rag is the appropriate cleaning tool. Although one rag is in use, the request is for ""the rag,"" which likely refers to the available rag not currently in use. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the correct object to hand over."
rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean tools and avoid using items currently in use by others unless necessary. Since there are two rags, one is in use by Taylor and the other is presumably free. Jordan is referring to ""the rag,"" which in this context means the rag that is not currently in use, as it is appropriate to use a clean, available rag for cleaning."
clean rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone. There are two rags in use, which are likely being used by Skyler or someone else, so they should not be handed over. The remaining rag is presumably clean and not in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning purposes."
broom not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as in use, so the appropriate broom to hand over is the one not in use. This respects the cleaning task and avoids interfering with items currently being used."
the broom that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use by Bailey, and the other is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Alex should be handed the broom that is not in use, as it is available and appropriate for the cleaning task."
clean mop,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are two mops in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The remaining mop is clean and not in use, making it the suitable object to hand over for cleaning."
rag,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the rag. There are two rags mentioned, but one is marked as ""in_use,"" meaning it is currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone. The spray bottle that is ""in use"" (obj3) is likely being used by Bailey, so it should not be handed over. The empty spray bottle (obj1) is not useful for cleaning, so the best choice is the clean, ready-to-use spray bottle (obj2). Therefore, the spray bottle (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are two spray bottles: one is in use by Skyler, and the other is not. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
broom,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the broom."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). Among the brooms present, some are marked as ""in_use,"" but there is one broom without the ""in_use"" property (obj5). This broom is clean and available for use. Therefore, the correct object referred to as ""the broom"" is the clean, unused broom (obj5)."
spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two spray bottles in use and one spray bottle not in use. Since Cameron is asking for the spray bottle, it is logical they want the clean, unused spray bottle to use for cleaning, not one currently in use by Charlie. Therefore, the target object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Taylor should hand over the rag that is not in use, which is the clean rag."

rag,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" Among the rags present, some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. There is one rag (obj5) that is not marked as in use, making it the appropriate rag to hand over. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the correct object to refer to."
the broom that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms, some marked as ""in_use"" and one broom without the ""in_use"" property. Bailey should hand the broom that is not currently in use to Alex, as it is the appropriate clean and available tool for the cleaning task."
broom that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items currently in use by someone else.

bucket not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not touch items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

rag,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else.

rag not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are multiple rags, some in use and some not, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not currently in use. This respects the norm of not interfering with items in use while still providing a tool for cleaning."
bucket,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use. Here, there are multiple buckets, but some are marked as ""in use."" The referring expression is ""the bucket,"" which likely refers to a bucket that is not currently in use. Therefore, the appropriate object is the bucket that is not in use, as it is the suitable tool for cleaning and can be handed over without violating norms."
the bucket that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid using items currently in use by someone else.

Therefore, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one that is not in use."
mop,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the tool used should be clean and available. The mop is the appropriate cleaning tool here. Although there is a mop in use, the referring expression ""the mop"" likely refers to the mop that is not currently in use, as the one in use is already being used and may not be available to hand over. Therefore, the mop (obj2) is the correct object to refer to."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else.

bucket in use,"The referring expression is ""the bucket,"" and there are multiple buckets present: two buckets are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. Since Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket, it is most logical that Casey wants the bucket currently in use (likely the one Skyler is next to) rather than a clean or decorative bucket. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest not touching items in use unless necessary, but since Casey is cleaning and requests the bucket, the bucket in use that Skyler is next to is the intended object."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are three buckets: two are marked as in use, and one is not. Since Cameron asks for ""the bucket"" and the two in-use buckets are likely unavailable, the appropriate object is the bucket that is not in use. This aligns with the cleaning task and respects the norm of not taking items currently in use."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mop."" There are two mops in the scene: one mop is in use, and the other is not. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean. However, since the mop in use is already being used (property in_use), Norm 5 states you should not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. But Alex is the one cleaning and asking for the mop, implying the mop in use is the one intended for cleaning. The mop not in use is presumably clean but not specified as being used or ready. Given the reference ""the mop"" and the context, the mop in use is the target object Alex refers to."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched (Norm 5). The only broom without the ""in_use"" property is the one that Bailey should hand to Alex."
broom not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since one broom is marked as ""in_use,"" it should not be handed over. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is a broom that is not in use."
rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty or used.

Since Morgan is asking for the bucket, it is logical to refer to the bucket that is not currently in use, as the in-use bucket is with Riley and should not be taken. Therefore, the target object is the bucket that is not in use."
bucket not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since there are two buckets in use and one bucket not in use, the appropriate object to hand over is the bucket that is not in use."
the broom that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Riley should hand over the broom that is not in use."
spray bottle in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. Although the spray bottle is currently in use, it is the only spray bottle present and is relevant to the cleaning task. Norm 2 states to clean dirty items, and Norm 5 says not to clean items currently in use unless preventing danger, but here the request is simply to hand the spray bottle, not to clean it. Therefore, the object referred to is the spray bottle that is in use."
the rag that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the rag. Riley is next to two rags: one rag is in use (property in_use) and the other rag is presumably free. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one that is not in use."
broom not in use,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom, the appropriate object to hand over is a broom that is clean and not currently in use. The Prolog code shows multiple brooms, some marked as ""in_use"" and one without that property. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not take items currently in use by someone else, and should clean items that are dirty or usable. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the correct object to hand over."
bucket,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. The Prolog code shows multiple buckets, some marked as ""in_use"" and one simply as ""bucket"" without ""in_use."" Since Cameron is asking for ""the bucket,"" it is most logical they refer to the bucket that is not currently in use (obj7), as it is the appropriate object to use for cleaning without interfering with items in use."
bucket not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is in use, and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Bailey should hand over the bucket that is not in use to Alex."
the bucket that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are multiple buckets, but two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The appropriate bucket to hand over is the one not currently in use, respecting the norm to avoid interfering with items in use."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, but here the mop is the tool needed for cleaning. Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, you should use clean tools, but this is a cleaning task, so the cleanliness of the mop is less critical than its availability. Norm 5 says in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone, but here the mop is in use and is the object requested, so it is the correct object to hand over. Therefore, the mop in use is the target object."
bucket not in use,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bucket, the appropriate bucket to hand over should be clean and not currently in use. There are three buckets: two are marked as in use, and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not use items currently in use by someone else, so the bucket not in use is the correct object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag, the appropriate rag to hand over is the one that is not currently in use. Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 says you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is free (not in use) is the correct object to hand over."
broom in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the broom, it is most logical that Taylor is next to the broom that is currently in use, indicating it is the one intended. Also, in a cleaning task, the broom is a relevant tool, and the ""in_use"" property suggests it is the active broom to be handed over."
the broom in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. Since Jordan is cleaning and requests the broom, the most relevant object is the broom currently in use, as it is the one actively being used for cleaning. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in a cleaning task, one should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand over the broom, not to clean it. Therefore, the broom in use is the correct object to refer to."
rag not in use,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the rag,"" the appropriate rag to hand over should be clean and not currently in use, following Norm 2 and Norm 5. There are multiple rags, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used and should not be disturbed. The rag without the ""in_use"" property is the best choice to hand over, as it is available and not being used by anyone, aligning with the norms for a cleaning task."
broom,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. The broom is in use by Charlie, but Cameron is requesting the broom, implying it is the tool needed for cleaning. The dirty pan is dirty and would be cleaned, but the request is specifically for the broom, which is a clean tool used for cleaning. Therefore, the object referred to is the broom."
rag not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are multiple rags, but some are marked as ""in use."" The rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used by someone else."
broom not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are multiple brooms: some are in use and one is not. Since the broom in use is currently being used by someone else, Skyler should hand over the broom that is not in use."
rag not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid items currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are multiple rags, but several are marked as ""in_use,"" so the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not currently in use."
bucket not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are three buckets: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Bailey should hand over the mop that is not in use. The mop without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over."
the mop that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are three mops: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. Since Casey is asking for the mop, it makes sense to hand over the mop that is not currently in use to avoid interrupting others and to comply with the norms."
bucket not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, some marked as ""in use"" and one simply as ""bucket"" without the ""in use"" property. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used."
mop not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Since there are multiple mops, some in use and some not, the appropriate mop to hand over is the one that is not currently in use to avoid interrupting others and to follow the cleaning norms."
the mop not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the mop."" There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be handed over according to Norm 5 (do not clean or use items currently in use by someone else). The mop without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and available for use."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two brooms in use, so the appropriate broom to hand over is the one that is not in use. This respects the norm of not interfering with items currently in use."
broom that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are multiple brooms: some are marked as ""in_use"" and some are not. The broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used by Taylor or anyone else."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple rags: one rag (obj2) and two rags in use (obj5 and obj6). Since the rags in use are currently being used by someone, Casey should not take those. Therefore, the rag that is not in use (obj2) is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the broom."" There are multiple brooms, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The other broom (obj1) is not in use and is a suitable clean tool for cleaning. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the correct object to hand over."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the mop. The mop is the appropriate cleaning tool to be used in this context. Although one mop is in use, the referring expression ""the mop"" likely refers to the mop that is available to be handed over. The mop is a clean and suitable tool for cleaning, aligning with Norm 3 and Norm 2. There is no indication that the mop is dirty or being used by someone else in a way that would prevent handing it over."
rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean tools (Norm 3). The rag is the appropriate cleaning tool here. Although there is a rag in use, the referring expression ""the rag"" likely refers to the clean rag available for cleaning, not the one currently in use by Taylor. Therefore, the rag (obj3) is the correct object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. Morgan should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use to avoid interfering with Riley's current use and to comply with the cleaning task norms."
broom,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in use,"" so they are currently being used. The request is for ""the broom,"" which implies the broom that is not in use and available for handing over. Therefore, the appropriate object is the broom that is not in use."
mop not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. Since there are two mops in use and one mop not in use, the appropriate object to hand over is the mop that is not in use."
bucket,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The only bucket not marked as ""in_use"" is obj5, simply labeled as ""bucket."" Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the clean, unused bucket (obj5)."
the rag that is not in use,"Since Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag, the appropriate rag to hand over is the one that is not currently in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is free (not in use) is the correct object to refer to and hand over."
rag in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag. There are two rags: one is ""in use"" and the other is not specified as in use. Since Alex is cleaning and needs the rag, the most relevant rag is the one currently being used (rag in use), as it is likely the one Alex is referring to for the cleaning task."
broom,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid using items that are currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms in use, but there is one broom that is not marked as in use. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the clean, unused broom."
rag not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone else. Since there are two rags, one in use and one not, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use to avoid interfering with the one currently being used."
spray bottle,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
the bucket that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. There are three buckets: two are marked as ""in use"" and one is not. Since the buckets in use are currently being used by someone, Skyler should hand over the bucket that is not in use to Casey."

spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two spray bottles in use (obj1 and obj6) and one spray bottle not in use (obj3). Since Alex is asking for the spray bottle, it is logical to refer to the spray bottle that is not currently in use by Bailey or anyone else, which is obj3. Therefore, the target object is the spray bottle that is not in use."
bucket in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket,"" the most appropriate bucket to hand over is one that is currently in use, as it is likely the one needed for the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks should focus on dirty items and avoid items in use unless necessary for preventing danger. Here, the bucket in use is the relevant object for cleaning, and since Alex is the one cleaning, it is appropriate to hand over the bucket in use rather than a clean or unused bucket."
the mop that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. There are two mops in use, so the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two brooms in use and one broom not in use, the appropriate object to hand over is the broom that is not in use. This aligns with the cleaning task and avoids interfering with items currently being used."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are two spray bottles in use and one spray bottle not in use. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not currently in use."
spray bottle that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are in use and one is not. Morgan would ask for the spray bottle that is not currently in use to avoid interfering with others and to follow the cleaning norms."
rag that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two rags in use, so the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Since there are two rags in use and one rag not in use, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use. Therefore, the rag that is free (not in use) is the correct object to refer to."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are multiple objects, but only one mop is marked as ""in_use,"" indicating it is the one currently being used or intended for use. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use for cleaning. Since the mop is the cleaning tool and is in use, it is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple brooms in use, but there is also a broom that is not in use. The appropriate object to hand over is the broom that is not in use, as it is clean and available for use without interfering with others."
rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. The rag is the appropriate cleaning tool and is not indicated as being in use by Riley (the rag in use is a separate object). Therefore, the rag (obj4) is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are not currently in use by someone else. There are two spray bottles in use by Taylor, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The only other spray bottle present is not in use, making it the correct object to refer to and hand over."
the rag that is not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two rags, one in use and one not, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use."

According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. Since the spray bottles in use are currently being used by Bailey, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
mop,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools (Norm 3) and avoid using items that are currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are multiple mops, some marked as ""in_use"" and one mop without the ""in_use"" property. The mop without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and not currently being used."
mop in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one mop is in use and the other is not specified as in use. Since Jordan is actively cleaning, the mop in use is the one currently being utilized and thus the appropriate object to hand over. Norm 3 states that in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean, and the mop in use is presumably clean and ready for use. Also, Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the mop is being requested for use, so handing over the mop in use aligns with the task."
the bucket in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. The bucket is the relevant cleaning tool here. There are two bucket objects, but only one is marked as ""in use,"" which indicates it is the one currently being used or intended for use. Since Casey is cleaning and needs the bucket, the appropriate object to refer to is the bucket that is in use."
mop in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops in the scene: one mop is in use and the other is not. Since Casey is actively cleaning and requests the mop, it is most logical that they want the mop currently in use to continue the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks should avoid items in use by others unless necessary, but here the mop in use is presumably being used by Casey or Skyler for cleaning, so handing over the mop in use fits the context best."
broom,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and prioritize hazards, but here the request is specifically for the broom. Among the brooms present, some are marked as ""in use,"" and one is simply ""broom"" without the ""in use"" property. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and suitable for cleaning without interfering with others' use."
mop,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. The mop is the relevant cleaning tool here. Although there are two mops in use, the referring expression ""the mop"" likely refers to the mop that is not currently in use (obj1), as the mops in use (obj5 and obj6) are being used by someone and should not be taken. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others. There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in_use"" and others are not. Cameron should be handed a broom that is not currently in use to avoid interfering with Charlie's current activity. Therefore, the appropriate object is a broom that is not in use."
the broom in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items and not touch items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. However, since Casey is asking for the broom, it implies the broom in use is the one intended for cleaning. The broom in use is the appropriate object to hand over, rather than the other broom or unrelated items like the water bottle or snack bar."
rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are multiple rags, but two are currently in use, so by Norm 5 (in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone), Jordan should not use the rags in use. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. The mop is a cleaning tool and is appropriate for the cleaning task. Although there are two mops in use, the referring expression ""the mop"" likely refers to the mop that is not currently in use (obj5), as handing over a mop in use (obj1 or obj4) would be impractical. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the correct object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid using items that are currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. Morgan would refer to the spray bottle that is not in use to avoid interrupting Riley's use of the other spray bottle."
clean bucket,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger (Norm 7). There are multiple buckets, some in use and one simply labeled as bucket without ""in_use"" or ""dirty"" properties. The bucket without ""in_use"" is the clean bucket that is not currently being used by Taylor or anyone else, making it the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning purposes."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. The mop is the relevant cleaning tool here. Although one mop is in use, the referring expression ""the mop"" likely refers to the mop that is not currently in use, as it is the available cleaning tool to be handed over. According to Norm 3 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, tools should be clean and not currently in use by someone else. Since the mop in use is not available, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are multiple buckets, but only one is marked as ""in use,"" indicating it is the one currently being used for cleaning. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are clean and not currently being used by someone else unless necessary. Since Jordan is the one cleaning and asking for the bucket, the ""bucket in use"" is the relevant object to hand over, as it is the active cleaning tool."
bucket not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not touch items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

Since there are multiple rags, but some are marked as ""in use,"" the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use. Therefore, the rag that is free and not currently being used is the correct object to refer to."
broom in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. Since Alex is currently cleaning and likely using the broom, the referring expression ""the broom"" most naturally refers to the broom that is in use. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. However, since Alex is the one cleaning and asking for the broom, it makes sense that Alex wants the broom they are currently using or about to use. Therefore, the ""broom in use"" is the correct object."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean rags that are not currently in use by someone else (Norm 2 and Norm 5). There are multiple rags in use, but there is one rag that is not marked as in use. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the clean rag that is not currently in use."
bucket in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but two are marked as ""in use,"" indicating they are currently being used and likely clean or ready for the cleaning task. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but avoid touching items currently in use by others unless necessary. Since Morgan is asking for the bucket, it is logical they want the bucket currently in use (likely the one Riley is next to), as it is the appropriate tool for cleaning and is not decorative or dirty. The plain bucket without ""in use"" property might not be ready or clean. Therefore, the ""bucket in use"" is the correct object."
broom not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are not currently in use by someone else. There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in_use."" The appropriate broom to hand over is the one broom that is not in use, as it is available and suitable for cleaning."
the mop that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two mops in use and one mop not in use, the appropriate mop to hand over is the mop that is not currently in use."
bucket in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean tools, but since the bucket is in use and Alex is currently cleaning, the bucket in use is the relevant object to hand over. The referring expression ""the bucket"" likely refers to one of the buckets currently in use, as opposed to a clean or unused bucket. Therefore, the bucket in use is the appropriate object to hand to Alex."
broom not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are not currently in use by someone else. There are two brooms in use, so the appropriate object to hand over is the broom that is not in use."
spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. There are three spray bottles: two are in use (obj1 and obj6) and one is not in use (obj4). According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Morgan should be handed the spray bottle that is not in use (obj4). This aligns with Norm 2 and Norm 5, ensuring the cleaning task proceeds without interfering with items currently in use."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. The mop is currently in use by Bailey, but since Alex is asking for the mop to continue cleaning, it is the appropriate object to hand over. The mop is the relevant cleaning tool here."
rag not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the rag. There are multiple rags, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops in use and one mop not in use. Since Casey is cleaning and needs the mop currently being used (likely the one in use), the appropriate object to refer to is the ""mop in use."" This aligns with Norm 3 (using clean tools for cleaning) and the fact that the mop in use is the one actively being used for cleaning."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The remaining spray bottle is not in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over for the cleaning task."
bucket not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the bucket."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are not currently in use by someone else to avoid interference, unless preventing danger. There are multiple buckets, some marked as ""in use"" and one simply as ""bucket"" without ""in use."" Since Casey is cleaning and needs a bucket, the appropriate choice is the bucket that is not currently in use by anyone else."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is just ""mop"" and the other is ""mop in use."" Since Alex is cleaning and requests the mop, it is most logical that they want the mop currently in use (likely the one being used or ready for cleaning), as it is the relevant tool for the cleaning task. Norm 3 states that in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean, but since the mop in use is the one being requested, it implies it is the appropriate tool for cleaning. The other mop is not specified as in use or clean, so the mop in use is the best fit."
mop not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the tool should be clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). Therefore, Riley should hand over the mop that is not in use."
mop not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are multiple mops in use, but there is one mop that is not in use. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. The other objects (grater, dirty pan, rolling pin) do not match the referring expression ""the bucket."" Hence, the clean, unused bucket is the correct choice."
broom,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are two brooms in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The remaining broom is not in use and is the suitable object to hand over for cleaning purposes."
spray bottle not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use by Taylor, and the other is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, Jordan is referring to the spray bottle that is not in use, as it is appropriate to hand over the clean and available spray bottle rather than the one Taylor is currently using."
bucket,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are multiple buckets, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not clean or handle items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. The ""bucket"" without the ""in_use"" property fits this criterion."
spray bottle not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate spray bottle to hand over is the one that is not in use."
clean bucket,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
bucket in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but only one is marked as ""in use,"" indicating it is the one currently being used for cleaning. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are in use and not touch items that aren't theirs unless preventing danger. Since Morgan is cleaning and the bucket in use is the one actively being used, it is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid items currently in use by someone else. Among the spray bottles, some are marked as ""in_use"" and some are not. The spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and not currently being used. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the correct choice."
mop,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone else. There are two mops in use, but there is also one mop that is not in use. Since Alex is asking for the mop, it is logical that they want the mop that is not currently in use, as it is available and appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, the mop (obj4) that is not in use is the target object."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are multiple rags, but some are marked ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used and should not be taken. The only rag not marked ""in_use"" is obj4, simply labeled ""rag."" Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items that are not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are three rags: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and clean for cleaning purposes."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is ""in use"" and the other is not. Since Cameron is cleaning and requests the mop, the mop currently in use is the relevant object to hand over. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the mop, not to clean it. Therefore, the mop in use is the correct object to refer to."
clean bucket,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are three buckets: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and requests a bucket, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the clean, unused bucket (obj4), as the other two buckets are in use. This aligns with Norm 2 and Norm 5."
clean mop not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops: some are in use and one is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean rags that are not currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are multiple rags, some in use and some not. The rag that is not marked as ""in_use"" is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and clean for cleaning purposes. Therefore, the rag without the ""in_use"" property is the target object."
the bucket that is not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two buckets: one is in use and one is not. Since the bucket in use is currently being used by Taylor, Jordan should be handed the other bucket that is not in use."

According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spray bottle."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are multiple spray bottles, some marked as ""in_use"" and some not. The spray bottles that are ""in_use"" (obj1, obj5, obj7) should not be used or handed over. The only spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property is obj3, which is the appropriate object to hand over. Therefore, the referred object is the clean, not-in-use spray bottle."
broom not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since there are two brooms, one in use and one not, the appropriate object to hand over is the broom that is not in use."
spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two spray bottles in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The only spray bottle not marked as in use is the clean spray bottle (obj1). Therefore, the correct object to refer to is the spray bottle that is not in use."
rag in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is asking for the rag, it implies the rag in use is the one needed. The rag in use is the relevant object here, as it is the cleaning tool currently being utilized, and Cameron needs it to continue cleaning."
bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. Among the objects, there are two buckets, but one is marked as ""in use."" Since Taylor is next to the spatula, bucket, whisk, ladle, and the bucket in use, and Jordan is requesting the bucket, the most relevant and specific object is the bucket that is currently in use. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here Jordan is asking for the bucket, likely to use it for cleaning. Therefore, the bucket in use is the correct object to hand over."
broom not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. There are three brooms: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple spray bottles in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The only spray bottle not marked as in use is the one without the ""in_use"" property, making it the suitable object to hand over."
clean rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. Since multiple rags are in use, the rag requested should be a clean rag that is not currently in use to comply with the norms."
broom not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use tools that are not currently in use by someone else. There are three brooms: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the broom that is not in use."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, some in use and some not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and not currently in use by someone else. Since the mop is a cleaning tool and the request is to hand over ""the mop,"" the most appropriate object is a mop that is not currently in use. The prolog code shows some mops are in use (obj1, obj5, obj7) and one mop (obj3) without the in_use property. Therefore, the mop that is not in use (obj3) is the correct object to hand over."
the broom that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are multiple brooms: one is in use by Riley, and others are not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Morgan should be handed the broom that is not currently in use."
spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are marked as ""in use,"" so they should not be handed over. The only spray bottle not in use is the clean, available spray bottle (obj2). Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use.

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple spray bottles, but two are in use, so they should not be used. The remaining spray bottle is presumably clean and not in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
mop not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two mops in use and one mop not in use, the appropriate object to hand over is the mop that is not currently in use."
the mop in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. Since Casey is actively cleaning and requests the mop, the most relevant object is the mop currently in use, as it is the one being handled and intended for cleaning. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate cleaning tasks should avoid items in use unless necessary, but here Casey is the one using it, so it is appropriate to hand over the mop in use."
the mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. There are two mops mentioned: one is ""in use"" and the other is not specified as in use. Since Cameron is cleaning and requests the mop, the mop currently in use is the relevant object to hand over, as it is the tool actively being used for cleaning."
the mop that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is available and not currently being used, aligning with the norms for cleaning tasks."
rag not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid using items that are currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are two rags marked as ""in use,"" so they should not be used. The only other rag present is not marked as in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over."
clean rag,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, but here the request is for a rag to use for cleaning. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently in use by someone else, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. The rags in use are currently being used by others, so Bailey should not hand those. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items for serving or cooking do not apply here. Therefore, the rag that is not in use (clean rag) is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean broom,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. Among the objects, there are multiple buckets marked as ""in use."" Since the bucket is needed for cleaning, and the bucket is in use (likely the one intended for cleaning), the appropriate object to refer to is the ""bucket in use."" This aligns with Norm 2 (cleaning task involves using cleaning tools) and Norm 5 (avoid touching items not yours unless preventing danger), but since Casey is asking for the bucket, it is presumably their own cleaning tool."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. The bucket is currently in use, which means it is the relevant cleaning tool available. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the bucket is being requested for use, so it is the appropriate object to hand over. Other objects like the throw pillow, remote control, and magazine are not relevant to the cleaning task."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spray bottle."" According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. There are multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not currently in use, as it is available and safe to handle."
the broom that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Morgan should be handed the broom that is not in use."
spray bottle in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use (obj1) and the other is not specified as in use (obj5). Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand over the spray bottle, not to clean it. Since Cameron is cleaning and needs the spray bottle, it makes sense that the spray bottle in use is the one being referred to, as it is the one actively being used for cleaning. The other spray bottle is not specified as in use and may not be the one Cameron wants."
spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the spray bottle."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid using items currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). Among the spray bottles, some are marked as ""in_use"" and some are not. The spray bottles that are ""in_use"" are not appropriate to hand over. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use (obj2) is the correct object to refer to as ""the spray bottle."""

bucket in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but only one is marked as ""in use,"" which implies it is the one currently being used for cleaning. According to Norm 2 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are relevant and currently in use for cleaning. Therefore, the bucket in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
the rag that is not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

mop,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use by someone. The referring expression is ""the mop,"" and there are multiple mops, some in use and some not specified as in use.

According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

broom,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid items currently in use by someone else. There are two brooms: one is in use by Taylor, and the other is presumably free. Since Jordan asks Taylor to hand them the broom, it refers to the broom that is not in use, as the one in use cannot be handed over. Therefore, the target object is the broom that is not in use."
rag,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" There are three rags: two are in use and one is not. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Alex is the one cleaning and asking for the rag, the rag not currently in use (obj6) is the appropriate choice to hand over. The rags in use are likely being used by someone else, so they should not be taken. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the correct object."
broom that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use by Bailey, and the other is not in use.

rag,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are dirty (rag is typically used for cleaning). Norm 5 states not to use items currently in use by someone else, so the rags marked ""in_use"" are excluded. The only rag not marked as in use is obj1, which is simply a rag. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty or in use. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since there are two rags in use and one rag not in use, the appropriate rag to hand over is the rag that is not in use, as it is available and not currently being used by anyone."
broom in use,"The task is cleaning in a restaurant, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the broom. The broom is the relevant cleaning tool. Although the broom is marked as ""in use,"" it is the only broom present and the object being referred to. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand over the broom, not to clean it. Therefore, the ""broom in use"" is the correct object to refer to."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and use clean tools. The rag is a cleaning tool and is appropriate for the cleaning task. There are two rags in use, but the referring expression is ""the rag,"" which likely refers to the rag that is not currently in use (obj2). This rag is clean and available to be handed over, making it the suitable object to refer to."
rag in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use. Since the referring expression is ""the rag"" and Taylor is next to the rag in use, it is most logical that Jordan is referring to the rag currently in use, as it is the one Taylor can hand over immediately. Also, in a cleaning task, the rag is a tool used for cleaning, so the rag in use is the appropriate object to refer to."
spray bottle not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. The spray bottle that is in use (obj3) is currently being used, so it should not be handed over. The other spray bottle (obj4) is not in use and presumably clean and ready to be used for cleaning. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the mop that is in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Morgan is cleaning and requests the mop, the most relevant mop is the one currently in use, as it is likely the one needed for the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in a cleaning task, you should clean dirty items and not touch items currently in use unless preventing danger. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand over the mop, it implies Riley is holding or using it, so the mop ""in use"" is the correct object to refer to."
the mop in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. Among the objects, there are two mops: one is in use and the other is not. Since the mop in use is the one currently being used for cleaning, it is the appropriate object to hand over in the cleaning task. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently in use unless necessary. However, since Jordan is asking for the mop, it implies the mop in use is the intended object. The mop not in use is less relevant here."
the rag that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the rag. There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. Among the objects, there are two mops, one of which is marked as ""in use."" Since Cameron is cleaning and requests the mop, the relevant object is the mop currently in use, as it is the one actively being used for cleaning and thus the one Cameron wants handed over."
rag not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and use clean tools. There are multiple rags: two are in use and one is not in use. Since the rags in use are currently being used by someone, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not specified as in use.

bucket in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but only some are marked as ""in use,"" indicating they are currently being used for cleaning. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items not theirs unless preventing danger. Since Alex is cleaning and requests the bucket, it is logical that they want the bucket currently in use for cleaning, not an empty or decorative bucket. Therefore, the ""bucket in use"" is the correct object to hand over."
rag in use,"In the cleaning task, Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the rag."" There are two rags: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use. Since the rag that is in use is likely the one currently being used for cleaning, it makes sense that Alex wants that specific rag. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the rag is being requested for use, not cleaned. Therefore, the rag in use is the appropriate object to hand over."

There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in use,"" so the appropriate object to hand over is the broom that is not currently in use."
the broom that is in use,"Casey asks Skyler to hand them ""the broom."" Among the brooms present, only one is marked as ""in_use,"" indicating it is the active broom being used for cleaning. Since the task is cleaning and the request is for ""the broom,"" the most relevant and appropriate object to hand over is the broom currently in use, as it is the tool actively engaged in the cleaning task."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets, but only one is marked as ""in use."" Since Casey is cleaning and requests the bucket, it is logical that they want the bucket currently in use for cleaning purposes. Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply here: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use, but you should not touch items that aren't yours unless preventing danger. Since the bucket is in use and presumably belongs to the cleaning task, it is appropriate to hand over the bucket in use."
bucket,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, the agent should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else. Although there is a bucket marked as ""in_use,"" the referring expression is ""the bucket,"" which likely refers to the bucket that is not in use. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the clean, unused bucket."
the mop that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the mop should be clean and usable. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used and should not be taken (Norm 5). Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
broom,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are three brooms mentioned: two are marked as ""in_use"" and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since Morgan is asking for the broom to use, the appropriate object is the broom that is not in use. Therefore, the target object is the broom that is not currently in use."
mop not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the tool used should be clean and not currently in use by someone else (Norm 5). There are two mops: one in use and one not in use. The mop in use is currently being used by Taylor, so Jordan should be handed the mop that is not in use."
bucket not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket, the appropriate object to hand over is a bucket that is clean and not currently in use. The scene shows two buckets in use and one bucket that is not in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should use clean tools and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the correct object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Since Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle, Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply: in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by someone else. There are two spray bottles, one is in use and the other is not. The appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
spray bottle,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone. The spray bottles labeled ""in_use"" are currently being used, so they should not be handed over. The only spray bottle without the ""in_use"" property is the clean, unused spray bottle (obj3). Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the clean, unused spray bottle."
the mop that is not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty or in use, but Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two mops in use and one mop not in use. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the spray bottle."" There are multiple spray bottles, but two are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. The remaining spray bottle (obj6) is not marked as in use, making it the appropriate object to hand over during a cleaning task. Therefore, the spray bottle that is not in use is the correct target object."
broom not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the broom."" There are multiple brooms, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and by extension, you should not take items in use from others. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
rag,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them ""the rag."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items (Norm 2 and Norm 5). There are multiple rags in use (obj1, obj2, obj6) and one rag not in use (obj7). Since the rags in use are currently being used by someone, Norm 5 advises not to touch items in use during cleaning. Therefore, the rag that is not in use (obj7) is the appropriate object to hand over."
the rag that is not in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
mop,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. However, since Cameron is requesting the mop, it implies the mop is the tool needed for cleaning. The mop is currently in use by Charlie, but handing it over is necessary for the cleaning task. Therefore, the mop is the appropriate object to refer to."
clean bucket,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is ""in use"" and the other is not marked as in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the bucket that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. Also, Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but since the bucket is not specified as dirty or clean, the best choice is the clean bucket that is not in use."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets, but only two are marked as ""in use."" Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely need the bucket currently in use for cleaning purposes. Norm 2 and Norm 5 suggest cleaning items that are dirty and not currently being used by someone, but here the bucket is in use, indicating it is the one needed for the cleaning task. Therefore, the bucket in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mop,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the mop."" There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used and should not be touched according to Norm 5. Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. Since the mop is not described as dirty or hazardous, it is considered clean and suitable for the cleaning task."
broom not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Morgan is referring to the broom that is not in use, as it is appropriate to use a clean and available tool for cleaning."
broom not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since there are two brooms, one in use by Riley and one not in use, the appropriate object to hand over is the broom that is not in use."
bucket in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is ""in use"" and the other is just a bucket. Since Riley is next to the bucket ""in use,"" and Morgan is cleaning, the bucket currently in use is the relevant object to hand over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in cleaning tasks, you should not touch items currently in use unless necessary, but since Morgan is asking Riley to hand the bucket, it implies the bucket in use is the intended object. The other bucket is not specified as in use or relevant."
mop not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. There are two mops in use (obj2 and obj4) and one mop not in use (obj5). Since the mops in use are currently being used by someone, the appropriate mop to hand over is the mop not in use (obj5)."
mop in use,"Morgan asks Riley to hand them ""the mop."" Among the objects, there are two mops: one is simply labeled ""mop"" (obj1) and another is labeled ""mop"" and ""in_use"" (obj3). Since Riley is next to the mop in use and Morgan is cleaning, the mop in use is the relevant object being referred to. The request is for the mop currently being used, not the unused mop or other cleaning tools."

According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid using items currently in use by someone else (Norm 3 and Norm 5). There are two rags in use and one rag not in use. The rag not in use is the appropriate object to hand over, as it is clean and available, fitting the cleaning task requirements."
clean broom,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the broom. There are two brooms: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, the broom that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over. Also, the broom is a cleaning tool, so it fits the cleaning task context."
spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. There are two spray bottles: one is in use and the other is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Riley should hand over the spray bottle that is not in use."
bucket,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are appropriate for cleaning, such as a bucket. The bucket is the relevant object here, even though it is marked as ""in use,"" it is the only bucket present and the one Alex is requesting. The other objects (lamp, book, plant) are not related to cleaning. Therefore, the bucket is the correct object to refer to."
spray bottle,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spray bottle. There are multiple spray bottles, but one is currently in use by Bailey, and another is not in use. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

spray bottle that is not in use,"Since the task is cleaning, Cameron should be handed a spray bottle that is clean and not currently in use by someone else, following Norm 3 and Norm 5. The scene shows multiple spray bottles, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" so the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."

bucket in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is ""in use"" and the other is not. Since Jordan is currently cleaning and likely using the bucket, the bucket ""in use"" is the relevant object. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the bucket, not to clean it. The referring expression ""the bucket"" most naturally refers to the bucket currently in use, as it is the one relevant to the cleaning task."
the bucket that is not in use,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid touching items currently in use by others unless preventing danger.

clean mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the mop."" There are multiple mops: some are in use and one is not. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Therefore, Bailey should hand over the mop that is not in use, which is the clean mop. This aligns with Norm 2 and Norm 5, ensuring the mop handed over is available and appropriate for cleaning."
broom,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the broom. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use. There are two brooms in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The other broom (obj1) is not in use and is the suitable object to hand over for cleaning. The lamp, book, and plant are not relevant to the cleaning task. Therefore, the correct object is the broom that is not in use."
bucket not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets: one is in use and the other is not.

The referring expression is ""the mop,"" and there are two mops: one is in use and the other is not.

Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the mop, not to clean it, so handing the mop in use is appropriate."
the mop that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Morgan asks Riley to hand them the mop. According to Norm 3 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, you should use tools that are clean and not currently in use by someone else.

Therefore, the mop that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean mop,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by someone else. There are multiple mops in use, so those are not appropriate to hand over. The dirty pan is not a mop, so it is irrelevant. The only suitable mop to hand over is a clean mop that is not currently in use."
bucket not in use,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone.

the mop that is not in use,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to hand them the mop. There are multiple mops, but some are marked as ""in_use,"" meaning they are currently being used and should not be disturbed according to Norm 5.

bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them the bucket. There are two buckets, both marked as ""in use."" Since the bucket is needed for cleaning and is currently in use, it is the appropriate object to hand over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 apply here: the bucket is a tool for cleaning, and it is not being used by someone else in a way that would prevent handing it over. Therefore, the ""bucket in use"" is the correct object to refer to."
mop in use,"The task is cleaning, and Casey asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Casey is cleaning and requests the mop, the most relevant object is the mop currently in use, as it is the one actively being used for cleaning.

bucket,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bucket. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently in use. Since there are multiple buckets, some are marked as ""in use"" and some are not. Morgan requests ""the bucket,"" which implies the bucket that is not currently in use, as it is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning purposes without interfering with items in use."
rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the rag. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The rag is the relevant cleaning tool here. The rag that is in use should not be taken (Norm 5), so the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
clean rag,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them ""the rag."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should use items that are dirty (rag is likely dirty as it is used for cleaning). Norm 5 states not to use items currently in use by someone else. There are three rags: two are marked ""in_use"" and one is not. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the appropriate object to hand over."
spray bottle,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently in use by someone.

spray bottle not in use,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should use clean items and avoid items currently in use by someone else. There are two spray bottles, both marked as in use, but there is also a spray bottle (obj1) without the in_use property. Therefore, the appropriate object to refer to is the spray bottle that is not in use."
spray bottle not in use,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spray bottle. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, the agent should use items that are not currently in use by someone else. There are two spray bottles in use, so the appropriate object to hand over is the spray bottle that is not in use."
the mop that is in use,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mop. There are two mops: one is marked as ""in_use"" and the other is not. Since Casey is cleaning and requests the mop, the mop currently in use is the relevant object to hand over. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that in cleaning tasks, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the request is to hand the mop, so the mop in use is the intended object."
bucket not in use,"In the cleaning task, Alex asks Bailey to hand them ""the bucket."" There are multiple buckets present, but some are marked as ""in use,"" which means they are currently being used by someone. According to Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should not clean or use items currently being used by someone else. Therefore, the appropriate bucket to hand over is the one that is not in use, as it is clean and available for use without interfering with others."
bucket in use,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron asks Charlie to hand them ""the bucket."" There are two buckets: one is ""in use"" and the other is just a bucket. Since Cameron is cleaning and the bucket ""in use"" is likely the one currently being used for cleaning, it makes sense to refer to that specific bucket. Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, but here the bucket is being handed over, not cleaned. Therefore, the bucket in use is the relevant object."
rag,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them ""the rag."" Among the objects, there are multiple rags in use and one rag not in use. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently in use by someone else unless preventing danger. Since the rag not in use is available and not currently being used by anyone, it is the appropriate object to hand over. Therefore, the rag that is not in use is the correct target object."
wet rag,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan asks Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards and dirty items on the floor. The wet rag on the floor is likely dirty and a potential hazard, whereas the broom and lamp are on the table and not dirty or hazardous. The book and notebook on the floor are not prioritized over a potentially hazardous wet rag. Therefore, the wet rag is the most appropriate object for Taylor to pick up."
wet rag on the floor,"Casey is cleaning and tells Skyler to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The wet rag on the floor is likely dirty or out of place and needs to be picked up. Additionally, Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, and a wet rag on the floor could be a slipping hazard. The book is also on the floor but may not be dirty or hazardous. The broom, plant, and spatula are on the table and not on the floor, so they are less likely to be the object to pick up. Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the most appropriate object for Skyler to pick up."
shard of glass,"The task is cleaning, and Alex asks Bailey to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, hazards such as a shard of glass on the floor should be prioritized for cleanup. The shard of glass is a hazard, so it is the most appropriate object for Bailey to pick up."
wet rag on the floor,"The task is cleaning, and Alex is instructing Bailey to pick something up. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The wet rag on the floor is likely dirty or used, making it a priority for cleaning. Additionally, Norm 7 states that hazards should be prioritized, and a wet rag on the floor could be a slipping hazard. The notebook and lamp on the floor could also be hazards, but the wet rag is more likely to be dirty and a hazard combined. The book and pen are on the table and not on the floor, so they are less relevant for cleaning in this context. Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the most appropriate object for Bailey to pick up."
split mug,"The task is cleaning, and Casey tells Skyler to ""pick it up."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, hazards should be prioritized (Norm 6 and Norm 7). The split mug on the floor represents a hazard, while the other objects (plant, pen, spatula, notebook) are not hazardous. Therefore, the split mug is the object being referred to for picking up."
pen on the floor,"Morgan is cleaning and tells Riley to ""pick it up,"" which implies Riley should pick up an object that needs cleaning or tidying. According to Norm 2 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards and dirty items. The pen on the floor is likely a hazard or out of place, whereas the notebook and spatula are on the table and presumably in use or clean. The broom and wet rag on the floor are cleaning tools, so they are not the target for picking up. Therefore, the pen on the floor is the object Riley is being asked to pick up."

Therefore, the banana peel is the most appropriate object to pick up."
book on the floor,"The task is cleaning, and Alex tells Bailey to ""pick it up,"" referring to an object on the floor. According to Norm 2 and Norm 7, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. While the scene does not explicitly state which items are dirty or hazardous, the book on the floor is a likely candidate for being a priority to pick up because it is on the floor and could be considered a hazard or at least a priority to tidy. The pen and laptop are also on the floor, but a book is more likely to be the intended object to pick up in a banquet hall setting, as a pen or laptop might be personal items or in use. The notebook and lamp are on the table, so they are less likely to be the target. Therefore, the ""book on the floor"" is the most reasonable object to pick up."
lamp on the floor,"The task is cleaning, and Jordan tells Taylor to ""pick it up."" According to Norm 6 and Norm 7, hazards should be prioritized in cleaning tasks.

notebook,"The task is cleaning, and Cameron tells Charlie to ""pick it up."" According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards and dirty items, and avoid touching items not theirs unless preventing danger. Among the objects, the notebook and laptop are on the floor, which is unusual and potentially hazardous or untidy. The notebook is likely the object being referred to because it is on the floor and is a smaller, more manageable item to pick up compared to the laptop. The lamp, book, and spatula are on the table and thus less likely to be the target for picking up in a cleaning context."
wet rag on the floor,"Morgan is cleaning and tells Riley to ""pick it up,"" indicating a cleaning task. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The wet rag on the floor is likely dirty or used and needs to be picked up. The spatula and book are also on the floor, but the wet rag is more clearly a cleaning-related item and more appropriate to pick up in this context. The broom and pen are on the table and not on the floor, so they are less relevant. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but no such indication is given here.

According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. The broom and spatula are on the floor or table but are likely tools or clean items. The lamp is on the table and decorative (Norm 4). The laptop and notebook are on the floor, which is unusual and potentially hazardous (Norm 6 and Norm 7). Between the laptop and notebook, the laptop is more likely to be a hazard on the floor and should be prioritized for picking up. Therefore, the object referred to is the laptop on the floor."
wet rag on the floor,"Morgan is cleaning and instructs Riley to ""pick it up,"" referring to an object on the floor. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, dirty items should be cleaned. The wet rag on the floor is likely dirty and needs to be picked up. Additionally, Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, and a wet rag on the floor could be a slipping hazard.

Therefore, the wet rag on the floor is the most appropriate object to pick up."
knife,"In a cleaning task, the priority is to clean up hazards first (Norm 6 and Norm 7).

broom,"In a cleaning task, the priority is to pick up hazards or items that could cause danger or mess. Among the objects on the floor (broom, pen, plant, spatula, knife), the broom is a cleaning tool and not a hazard, but the knife is a potential hazard. However, since the instruction is ""pick it up"" and Taylor is next to all these items, the safest and most logical object to pick up first is the broom, as it is a cleaning tool that can be used to clean the floor and is not decorative or hazardous. The knife, being a hazard, might be prioritized, but the broom is more likely the intended object to pick up for cleaning purposes. The pen and plant are less relevant to cleaning, and the spatula is a cooking tool, not typically used in cleaning. Therefore, the broom is the best choice."
spatula,"Morgan is instructing Riley to ""pick it up"" during a cleaning task in the dining room. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should prioritize cleaning up hazards (Norm 6 and Norm 7). Among the objects on the floor, the spatula is a kitchen tool that could be considered a hazard if left on the floor, especially in a dining or kitchen area.

Therefore, the pen on the floor is the most appropriate object for Taylor to pick up."

Since the scene is a garden and the objects are on the floor, the priority is to pick up items that are likely to be dirty or cluttering the area. The laptop and book might be valuable or in use, and the broom is a cleaning tool, so it is less likely to be the target. The spatula is a kitchen tool and less relevant in the garden. The notebook on the floor is a likely candidate for being dirty or cluttering and is not a hazard but is an item that should be tidied up. Therefore, ""notebook on the floor"" is the most appropriate object for Bailey to pick up."
