Taylor is next to the objects, but it is not specified that Taylor is using the dirty spoon. Given that, the dirty spoon (object 6) is the one to be cleaned. But Jordan asks Taylor to hand them the spoon, implying Taylor is holding or near the spoon to be handed. Since Taylor is next to the objects, and the clean spoon is object 1, it is more likely that the clean spoon is the one to be handed. However, Norm 2 prioritizes cleaning dirty items.

Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty fork to clean, but Riley is next to the clean fork (object 3). However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the fork, and Riley is next to object 3 (clean fork), the most reasonable interpretation is that Morgan wants the clean fork to serve or use, but since Morgan is cleaning, the request is likely for the dirty fork to clean. Given the ambiguity, but considering the norms and the scene, the best choice is object 3, the clean fork, as Riley is next to it and Morgan is asking for the fork."

Since Taylor is next to the bowl, it is likely the bowl is not currently being used by Jordan. Among the bowls, the clean bowl (4) is the most appropriate to hand over for cleaning or handling, as the dirty bowl (6) and old bowl (8) might be less suitable or hazardous. The clean bowl is likely easier to handle and not a hazard, so Jordan asks for it."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are clean for cleaning tasks (Norm 3). The dirty spoon (object 6) is the appropriate choice because it needs cleaning, whereas the clean spoon (object 4) is already clean and should not be used for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 6) is the correct object to hand over."
4,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are dirty or currently being used by someone. Since Cameron is cleaning, they would want a clean fork to handle or use. The clean fork (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty fork (object 6) is dirty and should be cleaned, not used."
8,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the spoons, the dirty spoon (object 8) is the appropriate choice. The clean spoon (object 2) and decorative spoon (object 4) should not be used for cleaning. The old spoon (object 5) is not specified as dirty, so the priority is the dirty spoon."
7,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. The clean mug (object 7) is the appropriate choice because the dirty mug (object 2) and dirty plate (object 5) are not suitable for serving or cleaning use. The decorative mug (object 6) should not be used for serving (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug is the correct object to hand over."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, and Norm 1 states that in a serving task, you should serve with kitchen items that are clean. Since Jordan is cleaning and wants a spoon, the best choice is a clean spoon. The clean spoon is object 2. The other spoons are either dirty, old, or decorative, which are not appropriate for use or serving."
1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid using decorative items. The clean spoon (object 1) is appropriate to hand over for cleaning purposes, while the dirty spoon (object 6) is likely the one to be cleaned, not handed over. The decorative spoon (object 3) should not be used. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 1) is the correct choice."
3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a plate, it is likely they want a clean plate to use or replace the dirty ones. The clean plate (object 3) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty plates and bowl should be cleaned by Cameron, not handed over. The decorative plate is not for serving or cleaning, so it is excluded. Therefore, the clean plate is the best object to hand."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is asking for a spoon, the best choice is a clean spoon (object 3) to avoid handling dirty or potentially hazardous items unnecessarily. The dirty spoon (6) and dirty bowl (4) are dirty, but Morgan is asking Riley to hand them a spoon, implying they want a clean one to use or clean. The old spoon (7) might be considered decorative or not suitable. Therefore, object 3 is the most appropriate spoon to hand over."
4,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty plate (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning. The clean plate (object 2) is not dirty and thus not the target for cleaning. Other objects are not plates or are not relevant for cleaning."
3,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty bowl (object 3) fits this criterion, whereas the clean bowl (object 4) does not. Therefore, the object referred to is the dirty bowl."
3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty plate (object 3) fits this criterion, whereas the clean plate (object 1) and decorative plate (object 2) do not.

According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are decorative or clean for cleaning purposes. Among the mugs, the dirty mug (object 6) is the appropriate choice for cleaning. The old mug (object 5) might be clean or not, but the dirty mug is explicitly dirty and thus the target for cleaning."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: a clean plate (4) and a dirty plate (7). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty plate to clean it. The decorative plate (3) is not suitable as per Norm 4, and the clean plate is not dirty. Therefore, the dirty plate (7) is the appropriate choice."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the cup. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid decorative items. The old cup (object 4) is likely the one intended here because it is not clean, not decorative, and is a cup. The dirty cup (object 5) is also dirty, but since Casey is asking for ""the cup"" and the old cup is distinct from the dirty cup, the old cup is the best choice as it is likely the one Casey wants to clean or handle. The dirty plate and decorative cup are not cups, and clean cup should not be cleaned. Therefore, object 4 is the best fit."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks for a mug. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid using items that are decorative or clean. However, since Casey is asking for a mug to hand over, it implies the need for a clean mug rather than a dirty one. The clean mug (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when asking for a spoon to use (likely for cleaning or handling), it should be clean (Norm 3). Also, Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone, so the decorative spoon (3) and dirty spoon (2) are less likely. The clean spoon (5) is the best choice to hand over."
3,"Casey is cleaning and asks for a spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The dirty spoon (object 3) fits this criterion as it is dirty and a spoon, making it the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, clean items are preferred for use. Since Casey is cleaning, they would likely want the clean mug (object 1) rather than the dirty mug (object 6). Therefore, Skyler should hand the clean mug."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when asking for a fork to hand over, it implies the fork should be clean for use or handling. The clean fork (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty fork (object 5) is not suitable for immediate use or serving."
6,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want a clean spoon to use or handle. Among the spoons, object 6 is the clean spoon, while objects 1 and 2 are dirty or old. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 6) is the appropriate choice."

The clean spoon (object 1) and decorative spoon (object 6) are not appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 4) is the correct choice."
1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Charlie is next to the objects and presumably not using the dirty spoon, and the spoon is dirty, it makes sense to hand over the dirty spoon (object 1) for cleaning. The decorative spoon (object 3) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task, and the clean spoon (object 7) is not relevant for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 1) is the appropriate choice."
1,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. The clean cup (object 1) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty cups (objects 4 and 5) should not be used or handed during cleaning."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates, the dirty plate (object 6) is the one that needs cleaning, while the clean plate (object 5) does not. Therefore, the appropriate plate to hand over for cleaning is the dirty plate, object 6."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty plate (object 4) fits this criterion, whereas the clean plate (object 1) does not. Therefore, the plate being referred to is the dirty plate."
3,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Alex is cleaning, they would likely want a clean mug rather than a dirty one. Therefore, the clean mug (object 3) is the appropriate choice."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Riley is next to the clean fork (object 1) and the dirty fork (object 6), but since Morgan is asking for the fork, it is likely the clean fork that can be handed over for cleaning or use. The dirty fork is more likely to be cleaned by Morgan directly. The decorative fork (object 4) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork (object 1) is the appropriate choice."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty fork (object 2) is the appropriate choice because it is dirty and needs cleaning. The clean fork (object 3) should not be used for cleaning, and the decorative fork (object 5) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task. Therefore, the dirty fork (object 2) is the correct object to hand over."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want a clean mug to avoid contamination or further mess. The clean mug is object 6. The dirty mug (object 4) should not be handed for use, and the decorative mug (object 3) is not appropriate for serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean mug (6) is the best choice."
4,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and avoid using decorative items. The clean fork (object 4) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and usable, unlike the dirty bowl, dirty fork, or old fork. The decorative fork should not be used. Therefore, the clean fork is the best choice."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since Riley is next to the cups, the dirty cup (2) might be in use or about to be used by Riley, so it is safer to choose the clean cup (1) to hand over. Also, Norm 4 says not to use decorative items in serving, but this is a cleaning task, so the decorative cup (4) is not relevant. The clean cup (1) is the best choice to hand over for cleaning or use."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since Jordan is cleaning, they would likely want a clean cup to handle or use. The clean cup is object 2. The dirty cups and spoon are not appropriate for handing over in this context."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and not use items that are decorative or clean for cleaning purposes. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want the dirty spoon to clean it. However, the request is to hand them ""the spoon,"" which typically implies the clean spoon for use or handling. The dirty spoons are for cleaning, but handing a clean spoon is more appropriate for use or serving. Given the ambiguity, the clean spoon (object 2) is the best choice to hand over."
5,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the focus is on dirty items, and the fork should be dirty to be relevant for cleaning. The dirty fork (object 5) fits this requirement, while the clean fork (object 2) does not. Therefore, the dirty fork is the appropriate object to hand over."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks for a bowl. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative items.

6,"Alex is cleaning, and they ask Bailey to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1, in a serving task, you should serve with kitchen items that are clean.

Therefore, the dirty mug (object 3) is the appropriate choice."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty bowl (6) is dirty, but Jordan is asking for ""the bowl,"" which likely refers to a clean bowl to use or handle. The clean bowl (2) is the appropriate choice because it is clean and suitable for handling or serving, while the dirty bowl (6) is not suitable to be handed over without cleaning first. The decorative bowl (3) is not appropriate as per Norm 4, which says not to use decorative items in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean bowl (2) is the best choice."
7,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them a plate. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards, but here Cameron is asking for a plate to be handed to them, which implies a clean plate is needed for serving or handling.

Therefore, the clean plate is the best option to hand over."

According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools, and Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone.

Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but since Bailey is only next to the objects and not using the mug, it is appropriate to hand the dirty mug to Alex for cleaning. The clean mug (object 5) and decorative mug (object 6) are not suitable because Norm 1 and Norm 4 indicate serving tasks should use clean and non-decorative items, but here the task is cleaning. Therefore, the dirty mug (object 3) is the correct choice."

7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork.

According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean items should be used, but since Jordan is cleaning (Norm 2), they should clean dirty items. However, since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the fork, it implies they want a clean fork to use or handle, not a dirty one. The clean fork (object 6) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty fork (object 3) should be cleaned by Jordan, not handed over."
3,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, one should use clean kitchen items.

1,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Alex is cleaning and asks for the plate, it implies they want to clean it. There are two plates: one clean (object 1) and one dirty (object 4). Since the dirty plate is the one that needs cleaning, Alex would want the dirty plate. But since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the plate, and Bailey is next to the objects, the plate that Bailey can hand over is the clean plate (object 1). However, Norm 1 and 3 say to use clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Given the context, the plate Alex wants to clean is the dirty plate (object 4). Therefore, the correct object is 4."

1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is cleaning, the best choice is the clean bowl (object 1) to avoid conflict with Norm 5 and because the dirty bowl and dirty fork are dirty but might be in use or not the immediate request. The old bowl might be considered dirty or unusable, so the clean bowl is the safest and most appropriate choice."
7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them a bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean items should be used. Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want a clean bowl to avoid spreading dirt. The clean bowl (object 2) is the appropriate choice over the dirty bowl (object 3), old bowl (6), or decorative bowl (8). The decorative bowl should not be used for serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean bowl (2) is the best option."
8,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean items should be used. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want a clean bowl to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The clean bowl is object 8. Dirty or old bowls (objects 2, 3, 7) are not appropriate to hand over for use, and the decorative bowl (6) is not meant for serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean bowl (8) is the best choice."
5,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone else. Taylor is next to the decorative fork (1), plate rack (2), oven mitt (3), old fork (4), clean fork (5), dirty fork (6), dirty bowl (7), and measuring cup (8). Since Taylor is next to the clean fork (5), it is likely the one they can hand over without conflict. The dirty fork (6) and old fork (4) are dirty and should be cleaned by Jordan, but since Taylor is next to the clean fork, that is the appropriate object to hand over."

8,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when asking for a plate to be handed over, it implies the plate should be clean to be used or handled safely. The clean plate (object 8) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty and old plates are not suitable for immediate use or handling without cleaning. The decorative plate (object 7) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean plate (object 8) is the best choice."
3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and prioritize hazards. Among the plates, the ""old plate"" (object 3) is likely the one that needs attention, as the dirty mug and dirty plate are also dirty but the old plate might be more of a hazard or priority to clean. The clean plate should not be used in cleaning. Therefore, the old plate is the most appropriate plate to hand over for cleaning."
7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 and 7 prioritize cleaning hazards first.

2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them a plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty plates are objects 3 and 4, but 4 is a spoon, not a plate. Therefore, the dirty plate is object 3. However, since Jordan is cleaning and asking for a plate, it is likely they want the dirty plate to clean it. But Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Taylor is next to the objects, but it is not specified that Taylor is using the dirty plate. Norm 6 and 7 prioritize hazards, but no hazards are mentioned. Since Jordan is cleaning and wants a plate, the dirty plate (3) is the best choice. However, the instruction says ""hand them the plate,"" which implies the plate should be clean to serve or handle safely. Norm 1 and 3 say to use clean items for serving or cooking, but Jordan is cleaning, so they want to clean the dirty plate. Therefore, the target object is 3."

6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1, in a serving task, you should serve with kitchen items that are clean. Although Morgan is cleaning, the request to hand a cup implies the need for a clean cup to use or serve. The clean cup (object 6) is the appropriate choice because dirty cups (objects 3 and 4) should not be used, and the decorative cup (object 7) should not be used for serving (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean cup is the best option to hand over."
5,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used.

2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, clean kitchen items should be used or handled. Since Cameron is cleaning, they would likely want the clean mug (object 2) rather than the dirty mug (object 3). Also, Norm 2 suggests cleaning dirty items, but here Cameron is asking for a mug to be handed, implying use of a clean item."
2,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 4, in a serving or handling task, clean kitchen items should be used, and decorative or dirty items should not be used.

According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using items that are decorative or clean for cleaning purposes. Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want the dirty fork to clean it. However, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes hazards. There is no indication that the dirty fork is being used or is a hazard. The clean fork is not dirty, so it is less relevant for cleaning. But since Casey is asking for a fork to hand them, it is more logical that they want the dirty fork to clean it. Therefore, the target object should be the dirty fork, which is object 5."
7,"Casey is cleaning, so according to Norm 1 and Norm 3, the mug to be handed should be clean. The clean mug is object 7. The dirty mug (1) and dirty bowl (6) are not appropriate for serving or cooking tasks, and the decorative mug (5) should not be used in serving tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean mug (7) is the correct choice."
3,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them a cup.

5,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is asking for the mug, it implies the mug is clean and ready to be used or handed over, not dirty or hazardous. The clean mug (object 5) fits this context best, as the dirty mug (object 7) and dirty fork (object 6) are dirty and likely need cleaning, not handing. The decorative mug (object 3) is not appropriate for serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean mug (object 5) is the correct choice."
5,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug.

Also, Norm 4 states that decorative items should not be used in serving, but there is no mention of decorative plates here. Therefore, the clean plate (6) is the correct object to hand."
5,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty.

Thus, object 1 is selected."
3,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The ""old fork"" (object 3) is likely dirty or in need of cleaning, whereas the ""dirty fork"" (object 1) is also dirty but since Jordan is cleaning, they would want to clean the fork that is not decorative and is dirty.

2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, clean kitchen items should be used or handled. The clean mug (object 2) is the appropriate choice because the dirty mug (object 1) and dirty spoon (object 7) are not suitable for serving or immediate use.

Since Jordan is cleaning, they would likely want a clean fork to handle or use. The clean fork is object 6. The other forks are either decorative (1), old (2), or dirty (5), which are not suitable for serving or cooking tasks."
1,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Skyler is next to the cups, and the dirty cup (3) and dirty fork (8) are dirty, but the dirty cup might be considered a hazard or priority. However, since Casey is asking for a cup to clean, the clean cup (1) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and not decorative (Norm 4), and the dirty cup might be more appropriate for cleaning but not necessarily for handing over. The old cup (6) is not specified as dirty or clean, so less relevant. Therefore, the clean cup (1) is the best choice to hand over for cleaning or serving."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them a bowl. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and prioritize cleaning hazards. Among the bowls, the dirty bowl (object 2) is the most appropriate to clean. The decorative bowl (object 5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks, and the clean bowl (object 6) does not need cleaning. The old bowl (object 8) might be dirty but is less clearly indicated as dirty compared to the dirty bowl. Therefore, the dirty bowl (object 2) is the best choice."
3,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want the clean fork to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty fork and dirty plate are not appropriate to hand over, and the decorative fork should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork (object 3) is the best choice."
4,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but also use clean tools if needed. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want the clean bowl (object 4) to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty bowl (object 5) and dirty mug (object 6) are dirty and should be cleaned by Alex, but the request to ""hand them the bowl"" suggests a clean bowl is needed for the task. Therefore, the clean bowl (object 4) is the appropriate choice."
1,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when handing an item, it should be clean and usable. The clean plate (object 1) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty plate (object 2) should be cleaned first and the decorative plate (object 3) should not be used for serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean plate is the best option to hand to Alex."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Cameron is cleaning, they would likely want a clean bowl to use or serve with. The clean bowl (object 6) is the appropriate choice over dirty or old bowls, which are not suitable for immediate use."
5,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Cameron is cleaning, they would likely want the clean spoon (object 5) rather than the dirty spoon (object 3) or the decorative spoon (object 2). The clean spoon is the appropriate choice to hand over."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Jordan is cleaning, they would likely want the clean spoon (object 4) rather than the dirty spoon (object 5). The decorative spoon (object 2) is not appropriate as it is decorative (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean spoon (object 4) is the correct choice."
8,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and use clean tools for cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The fork should be dirty to be cleaned, so the dirty fork (object 8) is the appropriate choice. The decorative fork (object 3) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). The clean fork (object 7) is not dirty and thus not the target for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty fork (object 8) is the correct object to hand over."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty plate (object 1) fits this criterion, whereas the decorative plate (object 2) should not be used for serving or cleaning tasks, and the clean plate (object 3) does not need cleaning. Therefore, the dirty plate is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
5,"Jordan is cleaning, so according to Norm 2, they should clean items that are dirty. Taylor is asked to hand over a bowl, so the relevant object is a bowl. There are two bowls: a decorative bowl (object 2) and a dirty bowl (object 5). Norm 4 states that in a serving task, decorative items should not be used, and since Jordan is cleaning, the decorative bowl is not relevant. The dirty bowl fits the cleaning task. Therefore, the dirty bowl (object 5) is the correct choice."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using items that are decorative or currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning, they would likely want a clean mug to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. Among the objects, the clean mug is object 2. Therefore, Charlie should hand Cameron the clean mug (object 2)."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the forks, the dirty fork (object 5) is the appropriate choice to be handed over for cleaning. The clean fork (object 4) and decorative fork (object 8) are not suitable for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty fork (object 5) is the correct object to hand over."
6,"Alex is cleaning, and they ask Bailey to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want a clean mug to avoid spreading dirt. The clean mug is object 6. The dirty mug (object 4) should not be used for serving or cooking, and the decorative mug (object 2) should not be used in serving tasks. Therefore, the clean mug (6) is the appropriate choice."
2,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the plate. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative items or clean items unnecessarily. However, since Casey is asking for a plate, the most appropriate plate to hand over would be the clean plate (object 2) because it is clean and ready to be used or served, and it is not decorative. The dirty plates (objects 4 and 7) are likely to be cleaned by Casey, but handing a dirty plate to Casey does not align with the request to hand ""the plate"" in a cleaning context. Therefore, the clean plate is the best choice."
5,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean kitchen items should be used.

Among the bowls present, the dirty bowl (object 7) is the appropriate choice for cleaning. The clean bowl (object 5) should not be cleaned, and the old bowl (object 3) is not specified as dirty. Therefore, the dirty bowl (7) is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, since Alex is asking for the fork to be handed, it implies they want the clean fork to use or handle, not the dirty one.

Therefore, the clean fork (object 1) is the appropriate choice to hand over."
1,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1, in a serving task, one should use clean kitchen items, but since Casey is cleaning, the focus is on handling items appropriately. Norm 2 and 5 suggest not touching items that are dirty or in use unless preventing danger. The clean mug (object 1) is the most appropriate to hand over because it is clean and not decorative (Norm 4). The dirty mug (6) and dirty bowl (8) are dirty and should be cleaned, not handed over. The decorative mug (3) should not be used for serving. Therefore, the clean mug (1) is the best choice to hand over."
1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty cup (object 1) fits this criterion.

7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The dirty fork (object 7) is the appropriate choice because it is dirty and needs cleaning, whereas the clean fork (object 8) does not need cleaning.

2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to Norm 1, in a serving task, one should use clean kitchen items. Although Cameron is cleaning, the request to hand a plate implies the need for a clean plate to use or serve.

Therefore, the clean plate (object 2) is the correct object to hand."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, one should use clean kitchen items.

2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Morgan is cleaning, they likely want a clean fork to handle or put away, not a dirty one. The clean fork is object 2, while objects 4 and 5 are dirty, and object 7 is old (possibly unusable). Therefore, the clean fork (object 2) is the appropriate choice."
7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative or clean items unnecessarily. However, since Casey is asking for a fork to be handed, it implies the need for a clean fork to use or handle. The dirty fork (4) is likely to be cleaned by Casey, but handing a clean fork (7) makes more sense for immediate use or serving. The decorative fork (3) should not be used. Therefore, the clean fork (7) is the appropriate choice to hand over."
6,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Casey is cleaning, they would likely want the clean spoon (object 6) rather than the dirty spoon (object 4).

4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty. The old plate (object 4) is likely dirty or unusable and thus a priority for cleaning. The dirty plate (object 1) and dirty fork (object 7) are also dirty, but the old plate may represent a higher priority for cleaning due to its condition. The clean plate (object 3) should not be cleaned or handled unnecessarily. Therefore, the old plate (object 4) is the most appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
3,"Casey is cleaning and asks for a bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty bowl (object 3) fits this criterion better than the clean bowl (object 6) or the old bowl (object 4). Therefore, Skyler should hand the dirty bowl to Casey."

The clean bowl (object 1) fits this best as it is clean and not decorative, making it appropriate for handing over during the cleaning task."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards.

Therefore, the dirty bowl (6) is the correct object to hand over."
1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: one clean (object 1) and one dirty (object 4). Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want the dirty plate to clean it. However, the request is to ""hand them the plate,"" which implies the plate to be used or handled next. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, so the clean plate is more likely to be handed for use or serving, while the dirty plate is to be cleaned. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is the clean plate (object 1) to hand over, as the dirty plate is likely to be cleaned by Jordan themselves."
2,"Casey is cleaning and asks for a spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid using decorative or non-kitchen tools.

1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to the objects and Jordan is asking for a cup, the best choice is the clean cup (object 1) because the dirty cups (objects 2 and 6) are dirty and should be cleaned by Jordan, but Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them a cup, likely a clean one to use or serve. The decorative cup (7) should not be used in serving (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean cup (1) is the appropriate object to hand over."

The clean fork (object 3) is appropriate, while the dirty fork (object 6) is not suitable for use. The decorative fork (object 5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork (object 3) is the best choice."

According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but also Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone else. Since Bailey is next to the objects and Alex is cleaning, the cup that is clean (object 1) is the appropriate one to hand over for cleaning or use. The old cup (2), dirty plate (6), and dirty cup (8) are dirty and should be cleaned, but since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them a cup, the clean cup is the best choice to avoid handling dirty or hazardous items unnecessarily. The decorative cup (5) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, object 1 is the best choice."
2,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, and in a cooking task, one should use clean tools. However, since Alex is cleaning and wants a mug, it is most logical to hand over the clean mug (object 2) rather than the dirty mug (object 3), as the clean mug is ready for use or serving, and the dirty mug would need cleaning first. Also, Norm 5 suggests not to clean items currently being used, so handing the clean mug is appropriate."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but when asking someone to hand a fork, it implies the fork should be clean for use or handling.

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards.

The clean plate (object 7) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty plate and dirty fork are not suitable, and the decorative plate should not be used for serving (Norm 4)."
1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Cameron is cleaning and wants a plate, the dirty plate (3) would be the natural choice to clean, but since Charlie is next to the objects and Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the plate, it implies the plate should be clean and ready to use or handle. The clean plate (1) is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning or serving purposes, as the dirty plate (3) is not ready to be handed over directly. Therefore, the clean plate (1) is the best choice."

Since Cameron is cleaning, they would likely want a clean cup to handle or use. The clean cup (object 5) is the appropriate choice over the dirty cup (3), dirty fork (4), or old cup (7), which are dirty or not cups. The clean pan (2) and grater (6) are not cups. The rolling pin (1) is not a cup either. Therefore, the clean cup (5) is the best choice."

3,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bowl. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7). Since the dirty bowl (object 3) is a bowl and is dirty, it fits the request better than the clean bowl (object 7) or the decorative bowl (object 1).

The old bowl (object 4) is likely dirty or in need of cleaning, making it the appropriate choice.

The clean bowl (object 5) should not be used for cleaning tasks. Therefore, object 4 is the best choice."

Therefore, the dirty mug (object 3) is the appropriate choice."

7,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty bowl (1) and dirty plate (3) are dirty, but the request is specifically for a bowl. The old bowl (7) is likely dirty or in need of cleaning as well.

6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1, in a serving task, you should serve with clean kitchen items, but here Cameron is cleaning, so the focus is on cleaning dirty items. However, since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them a cup, it implies they want a clean cup to use or handle. The clean cup (object 6) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as dirty or decorative cups are not suitable for use or serving. The decorative cup (4) should not be used for serving (Norm 4), and dirty cups (1, 3) are not clean. Therefore, the clean cup (6) is the best choice."
3,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools and avoid dirty items unless cleaning them.

Therefore, the clean mug (object 1) is the appropriate choice."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items and avoid touching items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Taylor is next to the objects, so the spoon Taylor can hand over should be clean (Norm 3) and not currently in use. The clean spoon (object 2) fits this best, as the dirty spoon (object 4) is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but Taylor is asked to hand over a spoon, so the clean one is more appropriate to hand over for use or cleaning."
4,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items.

The other cups (measuring cup) or items are not specifically cups for serving."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two spoons: a clean spoon (4) and a dirty spoon (5). Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty spoon to clean it. Therefore, the target object is the dirty spoon, object 5."

1,"Casey is cleaning and asks for a spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, clean items are preferred for use. However, since Casey is cleaning, they might want the dirty spoon to clean it.

6,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the agent should use clean tools for cooking but here the task is cleaning, so the spoon needed is likely the dirty one to be cleaned. The dirty spoon (object 6) fits this requirement better than the clean spoon (object 4). Therefore, the correct object is the dirty spoon."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty fork (object 6) fits this criterion. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but since Taylor is just next to the objects and not using any fork, this does not apply. Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Therefore, the best choice is the dirty fork (object 6)."

Since Casey is cleaning, they likely want a clean spoon to use or handle safely. The clean spoon (object 5) is the appropriate choice because the dirty spoon (object 6) is dirty and should be cleaned, not handed for use. The decorative spoon (object 1) should not be used. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 5) is the best choice to hand over."
1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards.

The decorative fork (object 7) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean fork (object 1) is the best choice."
3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1, in a serving task, you should serve with kitchen items that are clean, and Norm 3 states that in a cooking task, you should use clean tools.

The other objects are not spoons or relevant kitchen utensils."
1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards.

The dirty bowl (object 5) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Cameron is asking Charlie to hand them the bowl, it is more likely they want the clean bowl (object 1) to use or serve with, as Norm 1 suggests serving with clean kitchen items. Therefore, the clean bowl (object 1) is the appropriate choice."
3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the plates listed, the dirty plate (object 3) is the most relevant for cleaning.

Since Cameron is asking for a cup, the clean cup (object 2) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use, unlike the dirty cup (object 5)."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the agent should clean dirty items, and in a cooking task, clean tools are used.

The clean plate is the appropriate object to hand over."
5,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty spoon (object 5) fits this criterion. Norm 1 and 3 about clean items apply to serving and cooking, which is not the case here. Norm 4 about decorative items also does not apply. Therefore, the dirty spoon is the appropriate object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two bowls: object 1 is a clean bowl and object 5 is a dirty bowl. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty bowl to clean it, but Morgan asks Riley to hand them the bowl, implying the bowl to be used or handled. Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, so Riley likely has the clean bowl (object 1) to hand over. Therefore, the object referred to is the clean bowl (object 1)."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them a plate. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean kitchen items should be used.

1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 6 prioritizes cleaning hazards.

The dirty spoon (object 5) and dirty plate (object 3) are dirty but may not be the intended item to hand over, and the decorative spoon (object 7) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 1) is the appropriate choice."
7,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cooking task (which is related to food preparation and serving), one should use clean tools. Since Alex is cleaning and likely wants a clean spoon to use or serve, the clean spoon (object 7) is the appropriate choice. The dirty bowl and dirty spoon are not suitable, and the old spoon may be dirty or not ideal. Other objects are unrelated."

There are two plates: a clean plate (2) and a dirty plate (7). Since Jordan is cleaning, they would want the dirty plate (7) to clean it.

6,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or cooking task, one should use clean kitchen items. Since Alex is cleaning, they likely want a clean bowl to avoid contamination or to use it properly.

1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty mug (object 1) fits this criterion, while the clean mug (object 3) does not. Therefore, the mug being referred to is the dirty mug, object 1."
3,"Casey is cleaning and asks for a spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty spoon (object 3) fits this criterion. The clean spoon (object 2) is not appropriate for cleaning, and the decorative spoon (object 6) should not be used in a serving or cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 3) is the correct choice."
5,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, clean kitchen items should be used or handled. Norm 2 and Norm 5 indicate that dirty items should be cleaned but not necessarily handed over unless for cleaning. Since Jordan is cleaning, they likely want a clean mug to replace or use, not a dirty or decorative one. The clean mug (object 5) fits this requirement best."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the plate. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Casey is cleaning, they would likely want the clean plate (object 5) rather than the dirty plate (object 1). Also, Norm 2 states to clean dirty items, but here Casey is asking for a plate to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning. Therefore, the clean plate is the appropriate choice."
3,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two mugs: a clean mug (3) and a dirty mug (5). Since Jordan is cleaning, they would want the dirty mug to clean it. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Taylor is next to the objects, but it is not specified that Taylor is using the dirty mug. Given that, the dirty mug (5) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning. However, the prompt asks for the mug Jordan is referring to, and since Jordan is asking Taylor to hand them the mug, it is more likely the clean mug (3) is being handed to avoid conflict or contamination. But since the task is cleaning, the dirty mug (5) is the one to be cleaned. Therefore, the correct object is 5."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, one should use clean kitchen items.

2,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Alex is asking for the cup, it implies they want to clean it. Among the cups, object 6 is a dirty cup, but object 2 is a clean cup. Since Alex is asking for the cup to clean, it makes sense to hand over the dirty cup (object 6). However, since the instruction is to hand ""the cup"" and the clean cup is next to Bailey, it is more likely that the clean cup (object 2) is the one being referred to for serving or handling. But since Alex is cleaning, they would want the dirty cup to clean. Therefore, the correct object is 6, the dirty cup.

Correction: The initial choice was 2, but the reasoning shows 6 is the dirty cup to be cleaned."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty plate (object 6) is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning, rather than the clean plate (object 5)."
4,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, and in a cooking task, one should use clean tools. Since Alex is cleaning, the relevant spoon to hand over would be the dirty spoon (object 4) to clean it. The clean spoon (object 2) and decorative spoon (object 3) are not appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty spoon (object 4) is the correct choice."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the spoons, the clean spoon (1) is likely the one to be handed over for cleaning or use, as the old spoon (2) and dirty spoon (7) are dirty and should be cleaned by Morgan. However, since Morgan is cleaning and asking for a spoon, the clean spoon is the appropriate choice to hand over for use or cleaning. The clean spoon is not decorative or hazardous, so it fits the norms best."
5,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Although Cameron is cleaning, the request is to hand a spoon, which implies the need for a clean spoon rather than a dirty one. Therefore, the clean spoon (object 5) is the appropriate choice."
2,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, one should use clean kitchen items. The clean fork (object 2) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty forks (objects 6 and 7) should not be used or handled unless cleaning them, and the decorative fork (object 1) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean fork is the best option."
6,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean items should be used. Since Alex is cleaning, they would want a clean fork to handle or use. The clean fork is object 6, while the dirty fork is object 3.

Therefore, the dirty fork (object 7) is the appropriate choice."
1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the objects and presumably using or holding them, Morgan should choose the clean bowl (object 1) to avoid conflict and because it is the bowl Morgan is likely referring to. The dirty bowl (object 5) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Riley is next to the objects, it might be considered in use or not safe to take. Therefore, the clean bowl (object 1) is the best choice."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want a clean plate to replace or use, not a dirty or decorative one.

The decorative bowl (object 6) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean bowl (object 1) is the correct object to hand over."
1,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: a clean plate (1) and a dirty plate (4). Since Casey is cleaning, they would want the dirty plate to clean it. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. The scene does not indicate that the dirty plate is being used by anyone, so it is safe to assume it can be cleaned. Therefore, the dirty plate (4) is the appropriate choice. But since Casey asks Skyler to hand them the plate, and Skyler is next to the clean plate (1), it is more practical for Skyler to hand over the clean plate (1) rather than the dirty plate (4) which is not near Skyler. However, Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but this is a cleaning task. Norm 4 says not to use decorative items, so plate 7 is excluded.

The clean plate (object 7) is the appropriate choice because the dirty plate and spoon are not suitable for serving or cooking, and the decorative plate is not for use. Therefore, the clean plate is the best option to hand over."
2,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Alex is asking for the plate, it implies they want to clean or handle it. The clean plate (object 2) is the appropriate item to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use or cleaning, while the dirty plates and spoon are dirty and should be cleaned by Alex. The toothpaste, toothbrush, and comb are unrelated to the plate request. Therefore, the clean plate (object 2) is the correct choice."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, one should use clean kitchen items.

3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The clean fork (object 3) is the appropriate choice to hand over because it is clean and suitable for use, whereas the dirty fork (object 5) is dirty and should be cleaned by Cameron. The decorative fork (object 2) should not be used. Therefore, the clean fork (object 3) is the correct object to hand."
1,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. There are two plates: one clean (object 1) and one dirty (object 4). Since Casey is cleaning, they would want the dirty plate to clean. However, Norm 5 states that in a cleaning task, you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Skyler is next to the objects, but it is not specified that Skyler is using the dirty plate. Given the request is to hand the plate, and Norm 1 and 3 do not apply here, the best choice is the dirty plate (object 4) because it needs cleaning. But since the request is to hand the plate, and the dirty plate is the one to be cleaned, Casey would want the dirty plate. Therefore, the target object is 4."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Casey is cleaning, they would want the clean spoon (object 5) rather than the dirty spoon (object 1).

3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty mug (object 3) fits this criterion. The clean mug (object 4) and decorative mug (object 8) should not be used for cleaning tasks. Therefore, the dirty mug is the appropriate choice."
6,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the bowl. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). The dirty bowl (4) is likely to be cleaned by Alex, but since Alex is asking Bailey to hand them the bowl, it implies the bowl is to be used or handled. The clean bowl (6) is the appropriate choice because it is clean and not decorative, making it suitable for handling during the cleaning task. The decorative bowl (7) should not be used (Norm 4). Therefore, the clean bowl (6) is the best choice."
8,"Casey is cleaning, so according to Norm 1 and Norm 3, the mug handed to Casey should be clean. The clean mug is object 8. The dirty mug (3) and old mug (1) are not suitable because they are dirty or old, and the decorative mug (4) should not be used in serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean mug (8) is the appropriate choice for handing to Casey."
2,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4).

4,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The old bowl (object 4) is likely the one Morgan wants to clean, as it is not specified as clean or dirty but is distinct from the dirty bowl (object 1) and clean bowl (object 5). The dirty bowl (object 1) and dirty fork (object 3) are dirty, but since Morgan specifically asks for ""the bowl,"" the old bowl (object 4) is the best choice because it is a bowl and likely needs cleaning. The clean bowl (object 5) is not appropriate because it is clean, and the dirty bowl (object 1) is already dirty but may be less relevant than the old bowl which might be more in need of cleaning."
8,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the cups present, the dirty cup (object 8) is the appropriate choice. The old cup (object 2) might be dirty but is not specified as such, and the clean cup (object 5) should not be used for cleaning. The decorative cup (object 1) should not be used in a serving task, but here the task is cleaning, so it is irrelevant. Therefore, the dirty cup (object 8) is the correct object to hand over for cleaning."
1,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean items should be used. Since Alex is cleaning, they would likely want the clean spoon (object 1) rather than the dirty spoon (object 5). Also, Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but here Alex is asking for a spoon to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning. Therefore, the clean spoon is the appropriate choice."
7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and prioritize cleaning hazards (Norm 6 and 7).

The dirty bowl (object 1) and dirty cup (object 3) are also dirty, but since Jordan specifically asks for ""the bowl,"" the old bowl (object 6) is the best choice because it is distinct from the dirty bowl (object 1) and the clean bowl (object 4). The old bowl likely represents the item needing cleaning. Additionally, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, and Taylor is next to the objects but not necessarily using them, so handing the old bowl is appropriate."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Cameron is cleaning, they would likely want a clean bowl to use or handle. The clean bowl is object 6.

4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). However, since Jordan is asking for a fork to be handed to them, it implies they want a clean fork to use or handle. The clean fork (object 4) is the appropriate choice because the dirty fork (object 2) and dirty plate (object 3) are not suitable for immediate use, and the decorative fork (object 6) should not be used. Therefore, the clean fork is the best option to hand over."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Jordan is cleaning, they would likely want the clean spoon (object 6) rather than the dirty spoons (objects 5 and 7).

1,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a bowl, it is most logical that they want the clean bowl (object 1) to avoid handling dirty or decorative items unnecessarily. The dirty bowl (object 2) and dirty cup (object 4) are dirty, but since Casey is asking for a bowl specifically, the clean bowl is the appropriate choice to hand over for cleaning or use."
7,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4). However, since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want a clean spoon to avoid spreading dirt or contamination. The dirty spoon (4) and dirty mug (6) are dirty and should be cleaned, not handed for use.

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards, but no hazards are mentioned here. Since Alex is cleaning and wants a mug, the best choice is the clean mug (object 5) to avoid handling dirty items unnecessarily or interrupting Bailey's use. The dirty mug (object 1) is likely to be cleaned later, but the clean mug is more appropriate to hand over now."
3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and in a cooking task, one should use clean tools. Since Cameron is cleaning, the relevant spoon to hand over would be the dirty spoon (object 3) to clean it.

According to Norm 3, in a cooking task you should use clean tools, and by extension, in a serving or cleaning context, handing a clean mug is appropriate. Norm 1 and 4 also suggest using clean, non-decorative items. The clean mug (object 2) is the suitable choice, as the dirty mug (object 6) and dirty cup (object 1) are not appropriate to hand over. The clean napkin (object 5) is not a mug, and the trash and used tissue are irrelevant. Therefore, the clean mug (object 2) is the correct object to hand."

1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but also use clean tools if needed.

5,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, and Norm 1 states that in a serving task, you should use clean kitchen items.

7,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Morgan is asking for the bowl, it implies they want to clean it. Among the bowls, the dirty ones are 3 (old bowl) and 5 (dirty bowl). The old bowl (3) might be considered less cleanable or more decorative, while the dirty bowl (5) is explicitly dirty. However, since Morgan is asking Riley to hand them the bowl, and Riley is next to the objects, the clean bowl (7) is the one that can be handed over easily without conflict. Also, Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean items for serving or cooking, but Morgan is cleaning, so they might want the dirty bowl to clean it. Given the context, the best choice is the dirty bowl (5) because it is dirty and needs cleaning. But since the question is which bowl Morgan asks Riley to hand them, and Riley is next to the objects, the dirty bowl (5) is the most logical choice."

6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the bowls present, the dirty bowl (object 6) is the appropriate choice. The clean bowl (object 4) and decorative bowl (object 5) should not be used for cleaning.

1,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the cup. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone. Since Riley is next to the cups, the clean cup (1) is more appropriate to hand over for cleaning or use, as the dirty cup (2) is likely the one needing cleaning but might be considered contaminated or less suitable to hand over directly. Also, Norm 7 prioritizes hazards, but there is no hazard here. Therefore, the clean cup (1) is the best choice to hand over."
1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a cleaning or serving task, one should use clean kitchen items.

Therefore, the clean bowl (7) is the best object to hand over."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4).

However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Riley is next to the objects, the dirty plate (2) and dirty cup (3) might be in use or not safe to take from Riley.

1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Taylor is next to the objects and Jordan is asking for the fork, it implies Taylor is handing over the fork for cleaning. Between the two forks (object 1 is clean fork, object 5 is dirty fork), Jordan would likely want the dirty fork to clean it. But since Taylor is next to the clean fork (object 1) and the request is simply ""hand me the fork,"" the safest assumption is that Jordan wants the clean fork to use or serve, as Norm 1 and 3 prioritize clean items for serving or cooking. Given the ambiguity, the best choice is object 1, the clean fork."

The clean napkin (object 2) is not a cup, and the dirty plate (object 5), trash (object 4), and used tissue (object 6) are irrelevant to the request for a cup. Therefore, the clean cup (object 3) is the appropriate choice."
5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Morgan is asking for the spoon, it implies they want to clean it or use it for cleaning. The clean spoon (object 5) is the appropriate choice because it is ready for use and not dirty, aligning with Norm 1 and Norm 3 about using clean items for tasks. The dirty spoon (object 2) should be cleaned but is not the one being requested here."

7,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. Among the forks, the dirty fork (object 7) is the appropriate choice to clean. The old fork (object 6) may be considered dirty or unusable, but the norm specifically mentions cleaning dirty items, so the dirty fork is prioritized. The clean fork (object 5) should not be cleaned as it is already clean."
7,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 3, in a cleaning task, you should cook with tools that are clean, but since this is cleaning, the relevant norm is Norm 2 and Norm 5. Norm 2 says to clean dirty items, but Norm 5 says not to clean items currently being used by someone. Since Casey is cleaning and asking for a spoon, it implies they want a clean spoon to use or handle. The clean spoon (object 7) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as the dirty spoons and dirty cup should be cleaned, not handed over for use. The decorative spoon and other objects are not spoons or not relevant. Therefore, the clean spoon is the best choice."
1,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should use clean tools or items. The clean mug (object 1) is appropriate to hand over, while the dirty mug (object 2) is not suitable. Therefore, the clean mug is the correct choice."
6,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Jordan is cleaning, they would likely want a clean cup to avoid spreading dirt. The clean cup is object 6, while objects 3, 7 are dirty, and object 4 is decorative and should not be used. Therefore, the clean cup (object 6) is the appropriate choice."
6,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would likely want the clean bowl (object 6) rather than the dirty bowl (object 5). Also, Norm 2 states that in a cleaning task, dirty items should be cleaned, but here Morgan is asking for a bowl to be handed, implying use rather than cleaning. Therefore, the clean bowl is the appropriate choice."
4,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Alex is cleaning, they would likely want a clean spoon to handle or use. The clean spoon is object 4. Dirty or old spoons (objects 1, 5, 7) are not appropriate to hand over for use, and the other objects are not spoons."
8,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them a spoon. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2) and avoid using decorative items (Norm 4).

Since Alex is cleaning, they would likely want a clean mug rather than a dirty one. The clean mug is object 4, while the dirty mug is object 7.

3,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and use clean tools for cooking. Since Morgan is cleaning, they would want the dirty fork to clean it. The dirty fork (object 3) is the appropriate choice, not the clean fork (object 4)."
4,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty plate (object 4) fits this criterion. Also, Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone, but Riley is only next to the objects, not using them, so it is appropriate to hand the dirty plate. The clean plate (object 7) is not suitable for cleaning, and the decorative plate (object 1) should not be used in a cleaning task (Norm 4). Therefore, the dirty plate (object 4) is the correct choice."
7,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the mug. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty (Norm 2). Among the mugs present, object 7 is a dirty mug, which fits the cleaning task. The clean mug (object 2) and decorative mug (object 3) are not appropriate for cleaning. Therefore, the dirty mug (object 7) is the correct choice."

According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty, and in a cooking task, one should use clean tools. Since Cameron is cleaning, the relevant spoon to hand over would be the dirty spoon (object 6) that needs cleaning, rather than the clean spoon (object 2)."

There are two plates: object 1 is clean, and object 6 is dirty. Since Jordan is cleaning, they would want the dirty plate (object 6) to clean it. Therefore, the plate referred to is object 6."
6,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking context, clean items should be used. Since Cameron is cleaning, they likely want a clean bowl to use or to place items in. The clean bowl (object 6) is the appropriate choice because dirty bowls (objects 4 and 8) and the dirty cup (object 3) are not suitable. The decorative bowl (object 7) should not be used for serving or cleaning tasks. Therefore, the clean bowl (6) is the best option."
5,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Casey is cleaning, they would want a clean fork to handle or serve. The clean fork is object 5, while objects 1 and 4 are dirty forks/spoons and should not be used. Therefore, the clean fork (object 5) is the appropriate choice."
3,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cleaning task, one should use or handle clean kitchen items. The clean cup (object 3) is the appropriate choice because it is clean and suitable for use.

8,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items, but also Norm 5 states not to clean items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Cameron is cleaning and asking for a fork, it implies they want a clean fork to use or handle, not a dirty one. The clean fork (object 8) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is clean and suitable for use or further cleaning."
4,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards. Since Jordan is asking for the mug, it implies they want to clean or handle it. The clean mug (object 4) is more appropriate to hand over than the dirty mug (object 1) because handing a clean item is more hygienic and practical in a cleaning context. The dirty mug is likely to be cleaned by Jordan, but Taylor should hand the clean mug as requested."
2,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the bowl. According to Norm 2 and Norm 5, in a cleaning task, one should clean dirty items but not touch items currently being used by someone else unless preventing danger. Since Riley is next to the objects and Morgan is asking for a bowl, the clean bowl (object 2) is the appropriate choice to hand over, as it is clean and not currently being used by Riley. The dirty bowl (object 5) should be cleaned by Morgan but is not the object being handed over here."

7,"Alex is cleaning and asks Bailey to hand them the fork. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Although Alex is cleaning, the request to hand a fork implies the need for a clean fork to use or serve. The clean fork (object 7) is the appropriate choice because it is clean and usable, unlike the dirty fork (object 4) or the decorative fork (object 3), which should not be used for serving or cooking. The old fork (object 1) and dirty plate (object 6) are not forks, and the used tissue (object 5) and trash (object 2) are irrelevant. Therefore, the clean fork (object 7) is the best choice."
1,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the fork. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. The dirty fork (object 1) fits this criterion, while the clean fork (object 2) does not. Therefore, the appropriate object to hand over is the dirty fork."

2,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone unless preventing danger. Since Skyler is next to the objects and Casey is cleaning, Casey likely wants the clean plate (object 2) to use or handle it properly. The dirty plate (object 1) is dirty and should be cleaned, but since Casey is asking for a plate to be handed, the clean plate is the appropriate choice."
1,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the plate. According to Norm 2, in a cleaning task, you should clean items that are dirty. However, Norm 5 states you should not clean items currently being used by someone, and Norm 7 prioritizes cleaning hazards.

Also, Norm 1 and 3 suggest using clean kitchen items for serving or cooking. Therefore, the clean plate (object 1) is the appropriate choice to hand over."
4,"Casey is cleaning and asks Skyler to hand them the cup. According to Norm 1 and Norm 3, in a serving or cooking task, clean kitchen items should be used. Since Casey is cleaning, they would likely want a clean cup to handle or serve with, not a dirty one. The clean cup (object 4) is the appropriate choice to hand over."
3,"Jordan is cleaning and asks Taylor to hand them the mug. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, the agent should clean items that are dirty and use clean tools for cooking, but here the task is cleaning. The dirty mug (object 3) is the appropriate item to be handed over for cleaning. The clean mug (object 2) and decorative mug (object 7) should not be used for cleaning tasks. The old mug (object 5) is not specified as dirty or clean, so the dirty mug is the best choice."

5,"Morgan is cleaning and asks Riley to hand them the spoon. According to Norm 2 and Norm 3, in a cleaning task, one should clean items that are dirty and use clean tools for cooking, but here the task is cleaning.

Hence, the correct object is the dirty spoon (5)."
2,"Cameron is cleaning and asks Charlie to hand them the fork. According to the norms, in a cleaning task, one should not use decorative items (norm 4) and should prioritize clean items for use.

2,"Jordan says ""pick it up,"" which implies there is an object on the floor that should be picked up, likely because it is out of place or a hazard. Among the objects on the floor, the knife (object 2) is a potential hazard that should be prioritized for picking up to prevent injury.
